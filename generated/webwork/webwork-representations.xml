The function is linear with initial population of <m>1100</m> people and

<alert>(b)</alert> 
This function is exponential with inital population of <m>1100</m> and

(a) <m>r(10) = 700 - 30(10)=400</m>.



(b) <m>r(10) = 400</m> means water is entering the reservoir at 400 gallons
per second at time <m>t = 10</m> seconds.



(c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time <m>t = 0</m> seconds,
the water is initially flowing in at the rate of 700 gallons
per second.


The horizontal intercept tells us that at <m>700/30 \approx 23.333</m> seconds,
the flow has stopped.


The slope is <m>-30</m>.  This means that the rate  at which water enters the
reservoir decreases by 30 gallons per second each second. The water is
flowing in at a decreasing rate.



(d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, <m>r(t)</m>, is
positive because water is being added. Water is being added until
<m>t = 700/30</m> seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at
<m>t = 700/30</m>, the most water is in the reservoir.



(e) The reservoir has water draining out between <m>t= 700/30</m> and
<m>t= 40</m>, but this amount is not as much as the water that entered
between <m>t=0</m> and <m>t=700/30</m>. Thus, the reservoir had the least
amount of water at the beginning when <m>t=0</m>. Remember the function
<m>r(t)</m> gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir.



(f) If the domain is specified as <m>0 \leq t \leq 40</m> , then  the
rate varies from 700 gallons per second  at <m>t=0</m> to -500 gallons per
second at <m>t=40</m>, so the range is <m>-500 \leq r(t) \leq 700</m>.
In interval notation we express the range as <m>\lbrack -500, 700 \rbrack</m> .

a) The slope is <m>m = 0.062</m>, which tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by <m>0.062 \ \mbox{km}^2</m> per year.  Since 1 km = 1,000 m, it follows that  <m>1 \ \mbox{km}^2 = 1,000,000 \ \mbox{m}^2</m>.  Equivalently, the slope tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by <m>62,000 \ \mbox{m}^2</m> per year.




b) The <m>A</m>-intercept is <m>b = 16.2</m>, which tells us that in the year 2000, the area was <m>16.2 \ \mbox{km}^2</m>.




c) <m>f( 10 )</m> is the amount of area in the park covered by glaciers in 2012 (10 years after 2000).  <m>f(t) = 10</m> signifies how many years after 2000 will the area covered by glaciers be <m>10 \ \mbox{km}^2</m>.




d) We have <m>f( 10 ) = 16.2 - 0.062( 10) = 15.58</m>




e) <m>m = \frac{ \Delta A }{ \Delta t } = -0.062</m>.  Letting <m>\Delta t = 10</m> we have <m>\frac{ \Delta A }{ 10 } = -0.062</m> , and therefore <m>\Delta A = - 0.62</m>.  So about 0.62 <m>\mbox{km}^2</m> disappear in 10 years.




f) We have <m>16.2 - 0.062 t = 10</m>, so that <m>- 0.062 t = -6.2</m>, and finally  <m>t \approx 100</m>.

Since the function is linear, we can choose any two points (from the graph) to find its formula.  We use the form <m>p = b + mh</m> to get the price of an apartment as a function of its height.  We use the two points (10, 195000) and (20, 245000).  We begin by finding the slope

<me>m = \frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta h} = \frac{245000 - 195000}{20 - 10} = 5000</me>

Next, we substitute a point into our equation using our slope of 5000 dollars per meter of height and solve for <m>b</m>, the <m>p</m>-intercept.  We use the point ( 10, 195000):
<me>195000 = b + 5000 \cdot 10</me>
so
<m>145000 = b</m>.



Therefore, <m>p = f(h) = 145000 + 5000 h</m>.

      <solution><alert> SOLUTION </alert>



Both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> lie on <m>y = x^2 +3</m> , so their coordinates must satisfy that equation.  Point <m>Q</m> has <m>x</m>-coordinate 3, so <m>y = 3^2 + 3 = 12</m>.  <m>P</m> has <m>y</m>-coordinate 27, so
<me>\begin{aligned}
 27 \amp = x^2 + 3, \\
 x^2 \amp = 24, \quad\mbox{so} \\
 x \amp = \pm \sqrt{24}.
\end{aligned}</me>
Thus <m>x = - \sqrt{24}</m> because we know from the graph that <m>x \lt  0</m>.  Using coordinates of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, we know that

<me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{27-12}{- \sqrt{24} - 3} = \frac{15}{- \sqrt{24} - 3}.</me>

Since <m>y = 12</m> when <m>x = 3</m>, we have
<me>y = \left( \frac{15}{- \sqrt{24} - 3} \right) (x-3) + 12.</me>

To find the zeros, we solve the equation <m>0 = x^2 - 15 x + 50</m> . We see that this is factorable, as <m>y = (x - 10)(x - 5)</m>.
Therefore, the zeros occur where <m>x= 10</m> and <m>x= 5</m>.
