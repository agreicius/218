  "title": "How to Read Mathematics",
  "body": " How to Read Mathematics   Learning Goals    See suggestions for how to read math, and start thinking about how to implement these to best suit your needs and learning style    Learn how mathematics texts are organized around Definitions, Theorems, and Examples    There are many websites that provide guidance for students on how to read mathematics. Here are a few of them:    https:\/\/www.maa.org\/node\/121566 ,     https:\/\/web.stonehill.edu\/compsci\/History_Math\/math-read.htm ,     https:\/\/www.macalester.edu\/max\/math-econ-119\/howtoread\/ ,     https:\/\/brownmath.com\/stfa\/read.htm , and     https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1A0LT4BeL-J7Sw_jITi0iCwRnvYQut535\/view?usp=sharing      They all provide good advice and the main idea they all emphasize is that reading math (or really any technical writing) is going to take time and require your active involvement in order to understand what is written. However, you only have a limited amount of time in your day and you probably also have a very heavy workload, so you will need to read strategically, as well as actively.  Keep in mind as you read this section that you will need to take these ideas and experiment with them to find a system that works best for you. Just as everyone learns in different ways, everyone has a different way of reading that works best for them. If you have never learned mathematics by reading before, be patient with yourself and expect to improve over time as you adjust to the new format and refine your workflow.    Think about the following questions as you read.   Which of the ideas presented in this section resonate most with you?    Which strategies do you already employ?    What do you think you will start by trying?    How will you know if your reading method is working for you or requires changing?         General \"Do's\" for Reading Math  Here are some bits of general, practical advice to keep in mind while reading a math textbook. Some will work better for you and some will not, but you should keep an open mind about them all. If your methods are not producing the results you want, look through this list again and adopt some new methods that look like they will help with the issues you have identified.    Read multiple times and in multiple ways  You will almost certainly not understand or remember everything after a single reading! Expect to return to your notes and the textbook several times in order to fully grasp the material.    You may wish to skim through quickly first before reading a section in depth. Other people prefer to go through slowly first for details and then reread briefly to get the big picture. Try one or the other, depending on how much time and patience you have at the time.    If you are very confused by the reading before coming to class, return to the textbook after class and reread it to see how your new understanding helps the ideas fit together.    Return to definitions, theorems, formulas, and examples while working through homework problems. In particular, find any examples that seem to solve a similar problem.    \\text{ Do not } read through the textbook as a way to study for exams unless you have a specific purpose in doing so (creating a concept map, listing definitions, summarizing formulas, ). Reading the textbook without actively engaging with it is not an effective method of studying. See for tips on studying mathematics.      Read with paper and pencil (or tablet and stylus) nearby  You should take notes (especially of definitions and theorems) in a dedicated place in your notebook or tablet. Put key words in the margins so you can quickly skim your notes to find information. Underline or highlight as you would like, but be careful not to overuse such markings. Periodically summarize the big ideas of what you are reading, either by using appropriate headers or at the margins of your paper. If you do not already have your own note-taking method, I recommend the Cornell Note Taking System. You can find details at https:\/\/lsc.cornell.edu\/how-to-study\/taking-notes\/cornell-note-taking-system\/ . This involves organizing your page into multiple sections to capture different types of information: notes, cues (could be questions or key words), and summary. Math makes the most sense when you see it done out in front of you. One of the main challenges to reading mathematics is following lengthy computations. Working through these on paper at the same time as reading will help you follow each step, as well as pinpoint when you stop being able to follow the computation. This may not be the best to do the first time you read, however, as you may get lost in the details and forget why you were doing the computation. However, if you feel your eyes glazing in over in the middle of a lengthy equation, writing it down will help you focus, capture all of the details, and retain it in your memory.    Keep track of your questions  If something doesn't make sense, write down (in your notes) an explicit question that could help you understand. Flag your notes with post-its or stars or some other way that you can easily find them again; this is a benefit to Cornell notes as there is a separate area for questions. As you read more, you may answer your own questions and can add those answers to your notes. If not, you will want to be able to find these questions to ask them during class, office hours, or tutoring.    Avoid distractions while reading and choose your work environment deliberately  You may be able to read a novel or magazine with Netflix in the background or chatting with friends. If you read math and are not really concentrating on it, you will get very little out of it, and it will seem more difficult than it really is. 30 minutes spent focusing solely on your reading is more beneficial than spending 3 hours \"reading\" while distracted. If you are reading as part of a study group, make sure to set some ground rules about how often people are allowed to ask questions. Experiment with different environments to find what allows you to focus best. Silence the notifications on your phone\/computer\/tablet while you are reading! If that makes you uncomfortable, set a timer to check your notifications periodically (no more than every 15 minutes). Listening to music may be too distracting for you, or it may help you resist other distractions. Vary the type of music you listen to; some people prefer anything familiar while others need soothing or loud music. You may work better in a familiar environment, such as your dorm room, or you may need an impersonal space, such as the library. You may need a quiet, still space, or you may need ambient noise and bustle. Consider drinking water or another beverage while reading, or rewarding yourself periodically with a small snack such as an M&M. Mathematicians famously like to work in coffee shops, both for the ambient noise and the ease of obtaining more caffeine! Lastly, you will need to find what time of day works best for you for reading. You may prefer to read first thing in the morning when your brain is fresh, or you may think best in the evening or late at night when you do not have to think about what to do for the rest of the day. You may be forced to read at a particular time based on your schedule, but try to pay attention to when during the day your brain seems the most ready to focus and work.    Keep the big picture in mind  Even though the details of mathematics are important, the way that they fit together to work toward a larger goal give them real meaning. For each section you read, make sure you know the key ideas that are introduced as well as how they relate to the key ideas of previous sections. Cornell Notes (linked above) are great at helping to do this as they provide an explicit section of the page in which to summarize what you've learned. As you go through a calculation, always remember why that calculation is being done. What problem does it solve? What larger goal do the symbols represent? As you read an example, think about what definitions and theorems it illustrates, or if it shows how a mathematical concept can be used beyond the classroom. Ask what the motivation is behind the definitions and formulas; why was it worth inventing them in the first place?    Pay attention to details  In mathematics, every symbol and word counts, each sentence contributes to the bigger picture, and every diagram, table, and figure is purposeful. If you are at all uncertain about the meaning of a term or symbol, look it up or ask someone to explain it. Keep a list of new vocabulary. Pay attention to how symbols are used within mathematical expressions. For example, there is a vast difference between the symbols , and in mathematics. You probably won't have time to work through every example while you read, but at some point, make sure you know how to get from each step of a calculation to the next. In particular, be sure to notice when a definition, theorem, or formula is being applied, or if there is some other short-cut being used to get from one line to the next. Being able to follow a solution is a precursor to being able to solve problems for yourself. You may need to reread sentences a few times in order to fully understand what they are saying. Pay particular attention to how it relates to the material that has come before and how it fits into the current context. Is it introducing a new idea, building on an old idea, supporting a previous statement, pointing out something important, ?    Seek out alternate sources  This textbook contains all of the content you are responsible for, but that doesn't mean that it will contain enough examples or make perfect sense for every concept it introduces. Use other books, people, and technology to get answers to your questions and other perspectives on material that does not make sense to you. Do a quick internet search based on your questions, or ask your classmates, instructor, or tutors. YouTube is an excellent resource for modern learners of mathematics! However, be careful to find reputable sources for your information. Some of the best channels I've found are:    Khan Academy      The Organic Chemistry Tutor      patrickJMT      Professor Dave Explains      K. O. Math      Professor Heather Pierce Disclaimer: this is a friend of mine from graduate school, but she makes some great videos!      Numberphile (more for general interest; less instructional)     Hands on Math      Mathispower4u      ProfRobBob      Professor Leonard    If you prefer an alternate online textbook, here are two good options:    Paul's Online Math Notes      Active Calculus and Active Prelude to Calculus        Make it your own  The most important thing to do while reading math is to find a system that works for you and to make the content that you are learning relevant to your own interests. Everyone has a different set of tools and a different level of \"chunking up\" complicated ideas. Make the idea fit in with your own perspective and experience. Some people are most satisfied when they see a mathematical idea unfold from start to finish, following an idea from its origins and rediscovering why it is true, either via logical reasoning or experimentation. Other people need to contextualize information in a real-world context, in which case they prefer to motivate an idea with an application or tangible problem.

Definitions, Examples, and Theorems  The last section held general advice. This one contains specific directions for making sure you catch the most important parts of your reading. Pay special attention to definitions, examples, and theorems in a math text. They generally contain the most useful information and are the structure used to organize a mathematical text.   Definitions  Mathematics uses words very precisely, and not always in the same way that you would use them in your daily life. Mathematical definitions give the precise meaning of certain words that are meant to represent a specific idea. Words are typically written in bold the first time they are defined, which is intended to make them stand out from the surrounding text. If they are especially important, they are numbered and labeled, like so:  The words function, function notation, independent variable, and dependent variable are defined. The definition is numbered and has an orange bar to the left to make it more visible.   The above definition may or may not make sense to you or agree with what you think of when you hear the word \"function.\" If you don't immediately understand a definition, you may need to come back to it again later after reading some examples, asking questions, or finding alternate explanations of the term via Google or YouTube. When you encounter a new mathematical definition, you should write the term in your notes along with the accompanying definition, along with any other ideas that help you to understand it. While trying to be as precise as possible, write the mathematical meaning of the word in your own words, potentially accompanied by an example or two to help understand what the definition is intended to mean.    Theorems and Formulas  A mathematical Theorem is typically extremely important. If definitions are stones and examples show you how to put them together, then a theorem is a finished archway or wall. It is a mathematical fact, formula, classification, or connection between ideas that is especially useful for some purpose or is the culmination of a string of ideas leading to a particular goal. Think of mathematical knowledge as the city that is made up of houses constructed from the walls and archways of Theorems.  Definitions are put together to form Theorems. Theorems fit together to form a body of knowledge, such as the Theory of Calculus.   Theorems can also be called Propositions, Corollaries, or Lemmas , though we will not get into the distinction between these, and are typically so important that they are separated from the surrounding text in a shaded box. They are numbered so that they can be referred to easily:   Theorem 1.1 is a \"classification\" and gives a visual condition that categorizes a graph as either a function or not a function. The theorem also has a name by which it is commonly referred: the Vertical Line Test. Names of theorems often serve to remind us of their contents, though sometimes they refer to the person who discovered the theorem.   Theorem 1.2 is a \"formula\" and provides a short-cut for factoring the difference of two numbers or expressions that are written as squares.   Theorem 1.3 tells us a mathematical \"fact\" about products of numbers or expressions that are equal to zero. This is a very important property that relies on the theoretical structure of real numbers and real-valued functions. Theorem 1.3 is also the connection between the algebraic method of factoring and the task of solving an equation. Whenever you see a theorem, you should add it to you notes and take extra special care that you understand the purpose and meaning of the theorem. Because this course will not focus on mathematical proofs (logical arguments that explain rigorously why a theorem is true), you may or may not fully understand why a theorem is always true. The text should provide enough examples to suggest why it is true, or you could come up with a few more examples on your own if you are not yet convinced.    Examples and Non-Examples  It's not usually possible to get a full understanding of a concept without seeing it used a few times. The purpose of examples is to build your intuitive understanding, either by motivating an idea, clarifying details of a definition, theorem, or formula, showing how the idea can be used in context or to solve a problem, or providing multiple viewpoints from which to think about an idea. They may be mentioned briefly in a paragraph and you will have to recognize them via key words like, \"For instance \" and \" such as \". Other times, they are contained in separate environments meant to call more attention to them:   Example 1.1 follows immediately after Definition 1.1 in the text and illustrates the idea of a function introduced there, as well as the terms independent and dependent variable. It also introduces a new symbol and its meaning, the set of all real numbers. If Definition 1.1 did not make sense to you when you read it earlier, return to it and compare it with this example to see how the abstracted ideas in the definition are made more concrete in this example.   Example 1.22 follows Theorem 1.2 in the text as shown, and demonstrates how to use the formula presented for factoring a difference of squares.   Example 1.23 follows Theorem 1.3 in the text as shown. It begins with an expression that was factored in a previous example, and demonstrates how the property of multiplication in Theorem 1.3 allows us to set each of the factored expressions equal to zero and solve in order to determine where the full expression is equal to zero. The example goes on to contextualize the calculation graphically and provides a clickable link to a Desmos graph (you should always click on these as you are reading) in order to verify that the algebraic work is correct. A \"non-example\" is typically an example of something that does not fit a mathematical idea.   Example 1.8 illustrates how Theorem 1.1, the Vertical Line Test, is applied, and also provides an example of a graph that is NOT a function, meaning a \"non-example\" of a function. Non-examples are often just as enlightening as examples, if not more-so, because they show the limitations of the mathematical idea.     The four examples above illustrate definitions and theorems found in the text. Example 1.23 also makes connections to methods demonstrated in another example and a way of verifying and visualizing the result of a calculation. Some examples may illustrate a general method of solving a category of problems. Motivational examples may give you an intuitive or contextual introduction into an idea, while applied examples show you how a mathematical idea can be used in a real-world problem.  Here is a list of strategies to experiment with that can help you get the most benefit from the examples provided in the textbook. You do not have to implement all of them all of the time, but should consider these as suggestions to add to your toolbox of reading strategies:   Whenever you see an example, you should always think about what purpose it is serving. A good question to ask yourself is, \"How is this an example of what I was just reading?\"    Some examples will pose a problem to be solved and demonstrate how to solve it. Think about how to answer the problem, even for just a moment, before you read the solution. If you don't know where to start or were very wrong, you know you did not understand the concept underlying the example and may want to skim over earlier material again after reading the solution.    Summarize the main idea of an example after reading it and how it relates to the definition, theorem, formula, idea, etc. that it is meant to illustrate.    Make note of any questions that come into your mind as you read the example, such as how to get from one step of a calculation to the next, or whether the same idea could be used in a different context.    Try to think of other similar examples, as well as non-examples, before moving on to a new topic.       Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: Definition, theorem, proposition, corollary, lemma, example and non-example  Key ideas: Reading mathematics requires you to be actively involved in order to understand what is written. You will have to find a balance between efficiency and thoroughness in order to effectively learn from a mathematical text without spending hours and hours reading. This will likely take some experimentation with different strategies, so be patient and give yourself time to build this important skill.  \\fbox{Remember to return to Canvas and complete the Section 0.1 R&R!}  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 0.1}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "title": "How to Problem-Solve",
  "body": " How to Problem-Solve    Attribution: The framework and contents of this section were developed by Dr. Juliana Belding for the course MATH1100 Calculus I at Boston College, reproduced here with permission.    Learning Goals    Learn a framework for tackling complicated problems    Practice implementing the framework    Dispel some common myths about problem-solving      Why Problem Solving?   Problem-solving can mean many things. One way to describe it is as the ability to take an unfamiliar problem, make sense of the problem and come up with a way to solve it.  We'll work with both word problems and other problems. In particular, word problems are a training ground for the skill of mathematizing a situation that has words and numbers. We're not pretending these are necessarily realistic word problems but the point is for you to further develop your skills in more simplified situations and build your confidence. The hope is that this helps you become more comfortable looking at situations in a mathematical way, as you encounter more complicated ones.  Here we share a framework This framework is modified from that generated by George Polya, with credit also to Gizem Kaarali, Darly Cooper, Walter and Brown. to help you approach problems in an organized way. We'll explain it below and give examples of how you might use it.   Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Make a Plan    Carry out Your Plan    Reflect Back    Critique and\/or Change the Problem      Why a Framework?    A framework provides a structure to support logical problem-solving and slows you down, which is a good thing at first. As opposed to worrying that you can't remember how to solve the problem immediately, you get used to brainstorming and taking time to make sense of the problem.    A framework provides a common language so students in different sections can better work with each other and with instructors and TAs from other sections.     Very Important!! We are NOT suggesting that there is always one way to approach a math problem. This framework is meant to support you to work on a problem in a systematic yet individual, creative way. In particular,   In homework or class, we'll periodically ask you to try to use the framework. You will not be graded on precise use of the framework, but instead on the work shown and final results of your problem-solving.    We may model using the framework in class and in written solutions. Your work might look different or occur in different order than examples we provide. That is fine!    You may have a different approach to problem-solving that you like to use. That is fine! This is not meant to replace that, but rather to provide a(nother) pathway to problem-solving.       Problem-Solving Framework  Here's the framework. Warning! It can be overwhelming to read all at once. Instead we recommend you try an example problem alongside. Keep track of the things you do, and then come back to the framework, and see how it might help with solving the problem.   An Example Problem   A swimming pool is 2 m deep, 5 m wide and 60 m long. Water is pumped into it at the constant rate of 100 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the pool?  (Source: Cooper, 3.1.6)       Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)  Here are some possible things to do to help you understand the problem. You don't need to necessarily do all of them or to do them in a particular order.   Read it over once.    Visualize if possible: draw a diagram or picture, or sketch a rough graph.    Focus on what is being asked: What is the unknown information or the goal of the problem? What information is known?    Identify different quantities that might be relevant. Are they constant? Are they variables? Are they parameters?    Define notation and variables. Translate known and unknown information into notation and variables.       Make a Plan  In this step, the big point is to slow down and allow yourself to think versus trying to rely on a memorized approach. You brainstorm what could be relevant or useful to know or to do, and then make a plan to do it. You can actually carry out the plan in the next step. Here are some questions to help you.   What connections or relationships are there between known and unknown quantities? Does one change with the other?    What math tools, concepts, or formulas might be relevant?    Would making a table, function formula or graph be useful?    Is this like any familiar problem?   Then   Read over the problem again and decide which of the tools, relationships, are actually relevant and useful and make a step-by-step plan to use them.   It is important to note that your plan might not be the same as another person's. There are many pathways to solve a problem! Also, you may have done some work in \"Meet the Problem\" that helps you make a plan. These two steps are very connected.    Carry out Your Plan  In this step, you actually do the work of the plan, computing a value, graphing, solving an equation or whatever you planned.   Along the way, look back at what you planned. Are you on track?    Do you need to modify your plan?       Reflect Back (Looking Back)  In this step, we look back to see if we've solved the problem, check our work and think about what we've learned. Here are some questions to help you.   Have you answered the question(s)?    Can you check your answer?    Did you include units, if necessary? Do a unit check: do the units make sense?    Can you interpret the answer? Does it make sense?    Was all of the information relevant or needed?    Does the answer fit your intuition? What surprised you, if anything?       Critique and Change the Problem  This is an optional step, but it is a great way to exercise your critical thinking, get curious and creative, and think about how the problem might connect to more real-world situations.   Were assumptions made in the problem? What were they? Are they reasonable?    \"Word Problems\" in math classes are notoriously artificial. In what ways is the problem NOT realistic or practical? How could you change it to better reflect reality?    How would you change the problem to make it more interesting?    What other questions are you curious about after solving this problem?          Some Myths of Problem-Solving     Myth: If you can't solve a problem in 5 minutes, this means you can't do it  Definitely not! It might mean re-reading the problem to see it with new eyes, taking a break, or talking to a friend, classmate, or instructor about what you are thinking (but not asking them how to do it).    Myth: There is only one way to solve a problem  There are many ways to solve most every problem. We are sharing a framework, not a formula. Your work using this framework may look different than your peers or instructor.    Myth: Problems only have one right answer.  While this will be true of most of the problems we do in this course, in many situations, there are a range of answers depending on the assumptions and parameters of the problems.       Examples of Worked Problems  This section contains a few examples to help you understand the framework. Try the problems first using the framework, then see the examples here.  You'll notice that there is NOT one way to use the framework. You might have written more or less than here. The author here included some side thoughts, too, in parentheses. As you solve problems, you should feel free to add your personality and make it your own!   Here is a worked solution to Example . Remember: there are many ways to apply this framework! Your process may vary substantially to what is shown below.    Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Our goal is the time in minutes for filling the pool.    We know the dimensions of the pool. 60 m, 5 m, 2 m    The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is . It looks like this:  The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is .       We know the rate of water into the pool is 100 liters per minute.    Total Amount is rate time.      Make a Plan Here's one sample plan.    Find the volume.    Divide by the filling rate to find the time: , so .    The dimensions of the pool are in meters but the rate is in liters per minute. So we'll have to find a conversion before dividing or change units afterwards. We can use that 1 m  1,000 liters. A quick Google search will tell you this. We have a choice: cubic meters to liters or from liters to cubic meters? Let's do the first one An alternate plan: Convert the rate 100 L\/min to a rate with units cubic meters per minute. You get a rate of 0.1 cubic meters per minute. .       Carry out Your Plan   Volume cubic meters.    Now we need to convert. We want to convert cubic meters to liters. Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 L, the total volume in liters is L. (More than I expected!)    Divide by the filling rate to find the time. Since , we have , so .       Reflect Back (Looking back)   Did we answer the problem? It said \"how long\"? So 6,000 minutes. This is hard to think about, so how many days would this take? There are minutes in a day, so this is about 4 days.    This seems too long. Did we make an error? Did we forget a zero? After checking, we see we did not.    We always want to check units. Here's where we might catch ourselves if we forgot to convert, since we'd get units of cubic meters per (liters\/minute) which is not just minutes.    This seems like a long time, but this is a big pool (60 m is longer than an Olympic pool).       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This pool is odd-shaped. It's long but not that deep. How does it compare to an Olympic-size swimming pool?    It might not be realistic for the rate to be always constant. What happens if the rate varies?    Can we make a function to predict the volume at any point in time?    What if the pool also leaks water, or if there is a circulation of water in and out?          The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers, and someone has just made a metal band that circles the Earth, touching the ground at all locations. You come along at night, as a practical joke, and add 10 m to its length. The band is now sits magically just above the ground at all locations creating a gap.  How far is the new band above the ground: could a flea, a rabbit or even a person pass underneath it?  (Source: Band around the Earth Puzzle)    Here we work through all steps of the framework. Note: your work might look different or occur in different steps!    Meet the Problem ((Understanding the Problem)    We know the original band has circumference about 40,000 km.    The new band has circumference which is 10 m longer, so 40,000 km + 10 m.    We need to know how much space is created between the band and the earth.    Here a picture is worth a lot:  A band around the Earth that has been lengthened by 10 m.   From the picture, we see the space we want is the difference in the radius of the bands. We have the original radius and the new radius .    I wonder what can fit? 10 m seems small compared to the total circumference, so I'm guessing a flea.      Make a Plan   We can measure the space using the radius: The space is the difference between the new band radius and the original band radius.    The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we can use to find the original radius .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, so we can use to find the new radius . We need to convert 10 m to km first.    Then subtract the original radius from the new radius.    Then we can compare that to the height of typical things.     An alternate plan: There are other ways to approach this. For example, we can name the gap , since it's the change in radius. Then , and . The difference in circumference is 10 m and it's so we can solve for that gap.    Carry out Your Plan   The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we solve to find the original radius, .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, which is 40,000.01 km. We solve for ,    The space is km, or 1.6 meters.    1 meter is 3 feet, so this 4.8 feet. This is enough for person to pass under (if they bend down). Surprising!       Reflect Back (Looking Back)   I'm surprised it's this big a gap. I need to check I converted everything correctly.    I notice that it doesn't seem to matter how big the original circumference is because . The change in radius only depends on the change in circumference, not the original circumference.       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This is a strange problem - how could we make a band around the earth? Also, why is this a funny joke?    The earth isn't perfectly spherical. How does that affect it? Does it matter where we add the 10 meters?    Does it matter the size of the sphere? Would this be true on the moon? On Mars?    What sort of application could this have?    What can we learn about how radius and circumference are related?           The Northeast Regular train leaves NY for Boston at noon going a constant rate of 55 mph.

  "title": "How to Study Math",
  "body": " How to Study Math  Math is a subject best learned in small increments over a long period of time. Cramming for hours at a time is not an effective way to learn mathematics. The best thing you can do to help you study is to schedule relatively short (30 minutes - 1 hour) study sessions for yourself spaced out over the course of several days or weeks, as often as needed based on the amount of improvement you wish to achieve and how much material you hope to cover.  Leading up to an exam, you may wish to lengthen your study sessions, but do not push yourself past the point of mental fatigue. You will simply get frustrated and will not retain the material you review. Avoid working on math when tired. Think about the times of day when you are best able to focus and try to study during them.  Most importantly, find other students with whom to study . Do not work with someone far above or below your own level of understanding, but rather someone with whom you can exchange ideas equitably. Take turns suggesting problems or topics to review and explaining solutions and ideas to each other. Ideally, each of you understands what the other does not. However, you will also benefit from combining your partial understandings. The social interaction involved in working with another person will help you retain the information you learn. At the very least, making plans with another person to study will hold you accountable for using that time as intended.    Resources you can use to study  Plan when you begin studying to give yourself enough time to attend office hours or tutoring to ask questions. The resources below are available to you in order to identify what you need to know:    Your notes from reading and from class    Problems from in-class worksheets and the posted solutions    Old Check-Your-Understanding problems. Some have solutions that you can view after the due date.    Homework problems and posted solutions    Online resources, such as YouTube or online textbooks. There are specific suggestions in . Seeing an alternate explanation and additional examples may help you understand a topic. Just be aware that different sources do not all cover topics in the same way and material that you find online may not be relevant to the course; if something seems entirely unfamiliar and you can't find something similar in course materials, chances are it's not something you are responsible for knowing.    Explanations and examples in the textbook. Warning: Many people try to study by simply reading through a text from start to finish. This is not an effective way to learn. If you plan to read the textbook to study, you need to read actively. See below for details on active reading as it pertains to mathematical texts.      How to study effectively  A great way to begin your studying is to create a concept map of the big ideas being tested on the exam. Include all of the relevant definitions, theorems, and formulas. Reread comments left on homework and see which Check-Your-Understanding problems took you the most attempts to get correct. Do not study everything, but rather focus on those topics that give you the most trouble.     Practice Problems Math is best learned by actively solving problems. When practicing problems, complete them on your own with as little help from your notes or another person as possible. Only resort to consulting other resources when you are stuck and have already tried to get un-stuck.     Use Homework as Assessment Similar to the above point, use the work that you already have to do as a way to assess your understanding as you do it. Avoid copying methods from examples and their solutions but rather review your notes and then try the problem without looking.     Check your Solutions Use solutions to check your own work. If you get the same final answer, make sure that the intervening steps are the same or at least equivalent. If you use a different method to complete a problem than the solutions, compare them: Where do they differ? Which is more efficient? Which is more applicable to other, similar problems? If you do not get the same final answer, determine how much of your work is correct and precisely what kind of mistake you made.    If your mistake was based on faulty conceptual understanding, review or make a note to review material related to that concept.    If your mistake was computational, what can you do in the future to avoid the same mistake? If you find yourself consistently making the same computational mistakes, make a mental note to double-check your work whenever doing similar calculations.       Write Your own Practice Exams Combine problems from homework and worksheets and either do them yourself, or trade with a study partner. Having to solve a problem out of the context of a section of the text is a test-like challenge that is good to practice. Moreover, anticipating which problems are \"test-worthy\" and thinking from the perspective of the instructor can help you to anticipate the types of problems that will be on the exam.     Learn by Teaching and Learn as if to Teach Explaining an idea will make it stick better in your mind, so take turns in your study group explaining problems to each other. When working on your own, don't study with the intention of solving problems: study with the intention of teaching other people to solve problems. How much more thoroughly would you prepare to give a 50-minute lecture than you would to take a 50-minute test? Study as if you will be standing at the front of the class giving explanations, rather than sitting in a seat working on paper.     Review the Theory Review the definitions and theorems covered in class. Do not simply read through them, however. Find examples (from homework, the book, online) that relate back to them and explicitly connect the example with the ideas in the theory. Give a few examples that fit the definition or theorem, and try to find examples that do not fit. Compare them and determine what differences make the definition or theorem apply\/not apply.     Review the Computation Review all of the formulas and methods covered in class. Ideally, homework has given you enough practice with these so that you retain them. If not, find additional problems to practice. If you find yourself having a very hard time applying these quickly, make yourself a study sheet (maybe a notecard or a separate piece of paper) where you copy over the formula\/method and write out an example or two using that method. Briefly review this study sheet several times a day.   If using a notecard, you may wish to put the formula\/method on one side and examples on the other side.    If using a piece of paper, fold it down the middle and put the formula\/method and examples on opposite sides of the crease.        Read Actively Many people like to review their notes or the textbook to study. However, simply reading through explanations and examples is not an effective way to learn material. Do not confuse familiarity with understanding. You must read actively to benefit from reading, which for mathematics means:   Rework any examples or computations (with a pen or pencil on a separate piece of paper). Make a note of any steps you do not follow but don't let them get in your way of continuing to read. It's possible something included later in the text will clear up your confusion.    Identify the main idea of the section as well as the main idea of each subsection or paragraph. Connect these ideas: how does the material in the section support the main idea? How does the main idea of the section tie together the ideas of each subsection? There's no need to formally summarize your reading, but it's very useful to think about the big picture ideas as a way of understanding the details.    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to explicit examples that relate to them. Why do these examples fit? What change in the example would make it no longer fit? How are the specific details of the theory represented in the problem (for example, if there are constants used in the theorem, like a and b, that are given specific values in the example).    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to other sections covered in the text. What ideas does this section use? Where are these ideas used in subsequent sections?    If there are any words that you do not understand, look them up! If they were previously defined in the book, they will be listed in the index. If you can't find where they are defined, you can always google them. Just make sure that you are looking at a relevant mathematical definition. Oftentimes, words are defined to have very specific mathematical meanings that are not the same as their colloquial use. Sometimes, different areas of mathematics will use the same words to mean different things, so make sure the definition you find is familiar or seems relevant.        Seek Help from your Instructor The best place to get help is office hours. These are times your instructor has set aside to meet with students. You do not need an appointment to go. Questions can be about specific problems but can also be more general. Do not go with a laundry list of questions to get answered right before an exam, but rather attend office hours regularly and ask a few questions each time. Formulate your question (and write it down) ahead of time so that you can use the face-to-face time with your instructor productively. Bring any work you have attempted on a problem and show your instructor so that they can pick up precisely where you need help.      \\part{Fall Semester}  "

Recognize when a relationship is or is not a function; the Vertical Line Test.    Use different notations to describe sets: inequalities and intervals.    Explore some preliminary examples of functions used in real-world contexts.       Definition of a function  A function is a fundamental mathematical object that will form the basis of everything we study in this course. In this section, we will explore their definition and its meaning, several ways of representing a function, and a physical example of how functions are manifest in real-world phenomena.  What does the word \"function\" mean to you? Pause for a moment and consider   If you look up \"function\" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary (click on this link: https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function ), there are many different meanings. Which ones agree with the ideas you already had? The fifth entry  https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function accessed August 1, 2022 is the one we shall use, and we shall use both parts of it:   function (noun)   a mathematical correspondence that assigns exactly one element of one set to each element of the same or another set;    a variable (such as a quality, trait, or measurement) that depends on and varies with another For example \"Height is a function of age.\"   Part (a) of this definition is the abstracted, theoretical idea of a function. Part (b) of this definition is the reason we are interested in functions: we wish to describe relationships between real-world quantities. We will begin with the abstract idea before applying this knowledge to something more concrete.  In we give a formal, mathematical statement that we shall take to be the precise meaning of the word function . Return to this definition as you read the examples that follow in order to make sense of the notation and terminology.  To make our definition as rigorous as possible, we will make use of some notions and notation related to the mathematical theory of sets that we now officially introduce.   Sets and set membership      set membership    A set  is a collection of objects, called the members or elements of . We write if the object is a member of , and if is not a member of .  In the special case when a set consists of the finitely many elements , we write . Similarly, if the elements of are given by the infinite list , we write . The set descriptions in and are called enumerations or enumerative descriptions .     Set membership   Let . Since , , and are elements of , we have . Since is not an element of , we have .        We are now ready to define a function.   Function    a function from to    Let and be sets. A function  from to , denoted , is a rule which, given any input  , returns a unique output  . We write in this case, and call the image of under , or the value of at . Similarly, we say  maps (or sends ) the input to the output .  The set is called the domain of ; the set is called the codomain of .     Independent and dependent variables  The essential detail in the definition of a function , is that for each input in our domain the functions assigns a unique output in our codomain . This detail introduces a fundamental asymmetry between the roles of the variable and the variable in the context of the function . We codify this asymmetry with the terms independent variable and dependent variable .  In more detail, we call the variable , which is allowed to range freely over all elements of the domain , an independent variable of ; and we call the variable a dependent variable of , as given any input , the output is determined by .    Squaring function   Consider the rule that takes as input any real number and returns as an output the square of that number. This rule defines a function since for any real number , its square is uniquely determined.  Let's flesh out all the details of the function , as well as the accompanying notation. Observe that the phrase takes as input any real number implies that the domain of is , the set of all real numbers. Since the square of a real number is itself a real number, we see that we can also set our codomain to be .  Thus, in full and glorious detail, is the function defined as for all .  Letting and denote the independent and dependent variables of , respectively, we write or to represent the fact that the values of are the result of squaring , or equivalently, applying the function to .  Looking at some concrete examples of applied to various inputs, observe that we have . Using the language of , this means that the value of at is , and the value of at is also (or alternatively, maps both and to the output ).     Squaring function  The two input\/output statements from nicely illustrate the asymmetry in the roles of independent variable and dependent variable mentioned in . Whereas, by definition, corresponding to each input of a function there is a unique output , it is not necessarily the case that for each output of the function there is a unique input that gets mapped to it. In this case, we see that the output is the value of at two different inputs: and . More on this later, when we discuss invertible functions.   Intimately related to the squaring operation on is the notion of square roots. Recall that given a real number , a (real) square root of is a number satisfying . For example, is a square root of , since . It is possible to define a function based on square roots, but we have to proceed with caution, as the next example illustrates.   Square roots: a non-example   Explain why the following proposed rule does not define a function : given a real number , define to be the square root of .    There are two issues with this proposed function.   Firstly, not every real number has a (real) square root! Consider , for example. We cannot have for a real number since for any and . More generally, no negative real number has a square root.    The specific issue described in (1) is easily remedied by replacing our domain with the smaller domain of all nonnegative numbers , since it is a (nontrivial) fact that every nonnegative real number has a square root. However, a separate issue arises preventing from being a well-defined function. Namely, with the exception of , a nonnegative number has two distinct square roots. For example, the number has two square roots: and . This means there is no such thing as the square root, even if we restrict our attention to nonnegative numbers! Since our rule fails to assign a unique output for each input of the domain, it fails to be a function.       Our discussion of laid bare two issues that arise when defining a function that computes square roots: (1) not all real numbers have a square root; and (2) positive real numbers have two distinct square roots (if is a square root of , then so is ). The principal square root function defined in sorts these issues out by taking as its domain the set of all nonnegative real numbers (since nonnegative numbers do have square roots) and choosing for each nonnegative integer its unique nonnegative square root (only one of and will be nonnegative).   Principal square root function    the nonnegative square root of    Given any nonnegative real number , we denote by its unique nonnegative square root, and we call the principal square root of (or more casually, the radical of ).  Let be the set of all nonnegative real numbers . The function defined as is called the principal square root function .     Principal square root  Texts (and instructors) can be pretty sloppy when dealing with the principal square root operation, often referring to the expression as the square root of . This seemingly innocuous mistake can lead to larger misconceptions down the line. As such you are encouraged to adopt the following habit: each time you see utter to yourself the nonnegative square root of .     What are two other examples of functions that you can think of? These may be mathematical examples that you have seen before, or they may be real-world examples of a quantity that varies depending on another. Try to be creative!      Set-builder notation and intervals  In order to describe the domains, codomains, and ranges (see below) of functions we will need some more set theory concepts and notation.   Subsets  sets subset  sets inclusion    set inclusion     proper set inclusion    A set is a subset of a set , denoted , if every member of is a member of : , implies . The relation is called set inclusion .     Set-builder notation  sets set builder notation   Let be a set, and let be a property that elements of either satisfy or do not satisfy. For an element , let denote the statement that satisfies property . The set of all elements of that satisfy property is denoted .    Set-builder notation is a convenient means of carving out an interesting subset from an existing set using a defining property. For example, the set of all nonnegative real numbers, which appeared as the domain of the principal square root function, can be described using set-builder notation as . The next example uses set-builder notation to describe some familiar subsets of the integers .   Subsets of integers   We denote the set of all integers as : , we have .  Identify each set below as a familiar subset of and provide an enumerative description of the set.                        Using , we see that is the set of integers satisfying the property of being greater than 0. In other words, is precisely the set of positive integers. We can describe enumeratively as .    Again following , we see that is the set of all integers satisfying the property that they are equal to for some integer . Said another way, is the set of integers that are multiples of . Such integers are called even , and we conclude that is the set of all even integers. We can enumerate as .    Similar reasoning as above leads us to conclude that is the set of all odd integers: .       When dealing with subsets of it is often convenient to make use of interval notation . Intervals are special types of subsets of . Roughly speaking, for a subset of to be an interval means that if contains two elements and , then it also contains all real numbers between  an . The set of nonegative integers is an interval, and is expressed using interval notation as . Graphically we represent such an interval as a line segment (or ray) extending over a portion of the number line.   Number line representation of      Instead of burdening you with a formal definition of intervals, we simply provide in examples of various kinds of intervals. In that table and are assumed to be real numbers satisfying .   Intervals and interval notation    Interval notation  Set-builder notation  Interval type      Closed (finite) interval      Closed (infinite) interval      Closed (infinite) interval      Open (finite) interval      Open (infinite) interval      Open (infinite) interval      Half-open or half-closed interval      Half-open or half-closed interval          Note that, roughly speaking, a square bracket ( [ and ] ) indicates the inclusion of the corresponding number in the interval, whereas a parenthesis indicates that the number is excluded. Graphically speaking a number being included or excluded from the interval is indicated by either a closed (solid) or open dot, respectively.   Included and excluded elements of intervals    The interval     The interval       Not all subsets of are intervals. For example the set is not itself an interval. That said, we can often describe such sets as unions of intervals.   Set union and intersection    the union of and     the intersection of and     the set difference of and    Let and be subsets of a common set .   The union of and , denoted is defined as the set of all elements of that lie either in or : , .    The intersection of and , denoted is defined as the set of all elements of that lie both in and : , .    The set difference  is defined as .        Union of intervals   Let . Express as a union of intervals and represent graphically on the number line.    For an element to not be in is equivalent to either being less than or greater than : , we have or . Thus we have . We represent graphically as follows.   Union of two intervals      At this point we have introduced a number of important sets and their corresponding notation. Let's make these official with a definition. We also take the opportunity to add one more important set to our repertoire: the empty set .   Important sets    the integers     the real numbers     the empty set    The following is a preliminary list of some important sets.   Empty set  The empty set , denoted or , is the set that contains no elements.    Integers  The integers , denoted , is the set of all whole numbers and their negatives: , .    The set of real numbers is denoted . We do not give an explicit definition of this number system, but rather take it as a given.         Implied domain and range  According to , to give a complete definition of a function, we need to specify three things: the domain of the function, its codomain, and the rule that defines the value of the function at each of its inputs. Consequently, a statement like is technically speaking not a complete definition of a function, since it does not specify the domain and codomain in question. So as not to get bogged down by such technicalities, we hereby adopt the following convention in the form of an official decree, or fiat .   Implied domain   If a function is introduced via a formula without specifying a domain or codomain, we will assume that the codomain is and that the implied domain  is the set of all real numbers for which the formula can be meaningfully evaluated.     Implied domain: reciprocal function   Let be the function defined as . Following , give a full definition of this function by determining the codomain and implied domain. Use interval notation to describe these sets.    Since is only given as a formula, following , the codomain of is and the implied domain is the set of all real numbers for which the formula makes sense. Since the fraction is well-defined if and only of , we conclude that the domain of is the set of all nonzero real numbers: , . Thus, in all its glorious detail, and using interval notation, is the function defined as .    In addition to the domain and codomain of a function, another important set associated to it is the set of all possible outputs. Consider again the function , whose domain and codomain, following , are both equal to . You may recall, however, that squares of real numbers are in fact nonnegative real numbers: , for all . This means that the set of outputs of is strictly smaller than the codomain as it does not contain any negative real numbers. There is nothing wrong with this. In general, the codomain of a function should be thought of simply as a target set that the outputs of land in; our function definition does not insist that every element of the codomain must be an output of the function. That said, the set of all outputs of a function is important to us, and as such warrants an official name: the range of the function.   Range    the range of the function    The range of a function , denoted , is the set of all outputs of . Using set-builder notation , we have , or equivalently, .     Range depends on domain  Note that the definition of the range of a function depends very much on the domain , since it is the set of all outputs of the form , where . This is one reason why when defining a function we must know precisely what the domain is.  For example consider the two following functions: , ; , . Although the functions are defined using the same rule, since they have different domains, they are strictly speaking different functions. This difference is reflected in their having different ranges. Indeed, an argument along the lines of the ones given in and reveals that . As a result, when computing the range of a function, it is absolutely essential to know precisely what the domain of the function is.    Range: squaring function   Let be defined as . Compute , expressed using interval notation.    First we apply to determine the codomain and implied domain of . As always in this setting, the codomain is . Furthermore, since the defining expression of makes sense for any real number, we conclude that the domain of is and we write .  Next, by definition, we have . Since for all , and since every element of is of the form for some , we see that all elements of are nonnegative, and hence that . As you might have guessed, this set inclusion is in fact an equality: , we claim that .  To prove this claim, it remains only to show the reverse set inclusion: , that every nonnegative real number is an element of , or equivalently, that if , then we have for some . This in turn is equivalent to showing that if , then we can solve the equation for . Thankfully, this is not so difficult. Indeed, given any , the number satisfies . (Of course, is another solution to , but we only needed to provide one.) Putting it all together, we conclude that given any , we have , where . This shows that every nonnegative real number is an element of , and completes the proof that .     Range: principal square-root function   Let be defined as . Compute , expressed using interval notation.    Firstly, we observe that the implied domain of is , since the expression is only defined for nonnegative real numbers . We claim that . Indeed, since by definition is the nonnegative square root of , we have for all , and hence that . For the other direction, note that given any , we have . Thus for all , we have , where , and thus . We conclude that , as claimed.      Tables and graphs  In , you saw two different ways of representing the same function: a description in words (a rule that squares numbers), and a description via a formula ( ). In this subsection we introduce two additional forms of representation of a function: tables and graphs . This makes a grand total of four ways to represent a function:   a description in words    a formula    a table    a graph   We will need to be able to work with all four of these representations. Depending on what information we are given and what questions we have, one may be more or less useful than another.  A table (or table of values) for a function is just a rectangular display of a collection of inputs of together with their corresponding outputs (or values). For example, in here are two tables for the function that differ both in their choice of inputs and the manner in which the table is oriented.   Two tables for         x f(x)    0 0    1 1    2 4         x  -2  -1  0 1 2    f(x) 4 1 0 1 4       As illustrated by , a table of values of a function in general only provides partial information about that function: that is, it only tells us the values of the function for the chosen inputs, and remains silent regarding any other inputs. Indeed, the table in (b) above, by adding a few additional inputs, tells us something interesting about that the table in (a) did not reveal: namely, that sends multiple inputs to the same output.  A table would give us a complete representation of a function if it included the outputs for all of the possible inputs of : , if it displayed the input\/output pairs for all in the domain of . If the domain of happens to be an interval in , it is of course impossible to list all these input\/output pairs . In this setting a graph of the function can provide a useful means of visualizing all of the input\/output pairs of the function.   Cartesian plane   The Cartesian plane (or -plane ), denoted , is the set of all pairs of real numbers : , .     Graph of a function   Let be a function, where . The graph of , denoted , is the set of all pairs , where : , .    Producing a detailed graph of a function by hand is in general a challenging task. Indeed, in this course we develop sophisticated techniques based on calculus for doing just this! One way of proceeding, however, is to begin with a table of values for the function, plotting the resulting input\/output pairs in , and then extrapolating to get a full graph.  For example, starting with the table of values of in (b) of and adding a few additional input\/out pairs ( , ), we are able to produce a convincing graph of .   A graph of the function .    With a solid understanding of the precise relation between a function and its graph, you will be able to easily translate visual features of the graph into corresponding properties of the function. As a general rule of thumb, horizontal features of the graph of a function tell us something about the inputs of , and vertical features tell us about its outputs.  For example, to infer the domain of a function from its graph, we simply take note of all the -values of points on the graph. This can be done visually by mentally projecting the points of the graph onto the -axis and seeing what subset is produced. Similarly, the range of the function corresponds to the set of all -values of points appearing in the graph, and this can be visualized by projecting all of the points of the graph onto the -axis. Looking at the graph of given in , and imagining this graph as continuing in a similar manner indefinitely to the left and right, we see that projecting points onto the -axis produces the entire -axis, whereas projecting onto the -axis yields only the nonnegative portion of the -axis. This is visual confirmation that the domain of is all of , whereas the range of is just .  The following examples further illustrate this technique.   Graph: radical function   The graph of the function is given .   Use the graph to infer what the domain of is. Confirm your answer by computing the implied domain of .    Use the graph to infer what the range of is.      A graph of the function .         We see that the -values of points on the graph of seem to range over all real numbers less than or equal to . This suggests that the domain of is . To confirm this observe that the expression is defined only if . Now solve this inequality for : . We conclude that is defined if and only if , confirming that the domain of is .    The -values of the points of the graph of appear to range over all of . We thus infer that the range of is . (And indeed, this claim is readily confirmed using arguments as in and .)        Graph: rational function   An interactive graph of the function is given in .   Use the interactive to infer what the domain of is. Confirm your answer by computing the implied domain of .    Use the interactive to infer what the range of is.      Desmos interactive : graph of the function .         As we trace points on the interactive in , we see that the -values of points on the graph of appear to assume all values with the exception of and , suggesting that the domain of is . We confirm this algebraically by first noting that the expression is undefined exactly when . Now solve this equation: . (We review in more detail how to solve equations like in .) We conlude that is defined as long as and thus that , as claimed.    Tracing points in the interactive, we observe that for points in the left- and right-most portions of the graph, the -values of points assume all values except . (As we move points to the left or right indefinitely, the graph gets very close to the -axis, but never quite touches it.) On the other hand, for points in the middle section of the graph (between the lines and ), the -values appear to range freely over the interval . We infer from these two observations that .         Vertical line test  The graph of a function is a special example of a more general concept, the graph of an equation , which we now define.   Graph of equation   Consider an arbitrary equation , where is a mathematical expression in the unknowns  and , and is a fixed constant. A solution to is a pair such that evaluating the expression at and yields the true equation . The graph of an equation like is the set of all solutions to this equation: , .    Let's consider the equation as an example. Let's first try and produce a few solutions to this equation by hand. One trick that often comes in handy is to set one of the variables equal to zero and see what the other variable must be to produce a solution. Setting in reduces the equation to , which implies that . We conclude that and are solutions to . Similarly, setting gives rise to the solutions and . In all, we have managed to produce a set of four solutions to the equation: . This is far from the set of all solutions however. Indeed, observe that for each assignment with the expression is nonnegative, and hence we can solve as . This means for each , the pairs is a solution to , as is the pair . This yields infinitely many solutions to : two for each choice of . For example, setting in the expressions above yields the solutions and .  We can use technology to produce a detailed graph of . Alternatively, you might recognize this equation as defining a certain circle centered at the origin. (Don't worry if you didn't catch this! We will review such special equations in much more detail later.) Below we provide this graph, along with the few points we managed to produce by hand.   Graph of the equation   Plot of circle of radius 4     The graph of equation displayed in is similar in nature to the examples in the previous subsection. In particular, all of these graphs are curves of some sort in . One explanation of this similarity is that a graph of a function is just a specific example of a graph of an equation . Indeed, given function , its graph is just the graph of the equation (with the restriction that -values of solutions must lie in ). So are there any differences between graphs of functions and graphs of curves more generally? Yes! The defining property of a function is that for each input of a function , there is exactly one input\/output pair on the graph of . Graphically, this means that for each point on the -axis, there is at most one point on the graph of with -coordinate equal to : equivalently, there is at most one point of the graph of lying on the line . This simple observation is the essence of the vertical line text .   Vertical line test   Let be a set of points in .  If for all , the vertical line intersects in at most one point , then is the graph of a function.  Conversely, if there is any vertical line that intersects at more than one point , then is not the graph of a function.    The quantifiers for all and there is appearing in are very important. To clarify their role in the statement of the theorem, let's introduce some additional terminology. Given a vertical line , let's say that a set  passes the -test if intersects in at most one point; similarly, we will say  fails the -test if intersects in more than one point. In terms of this new language, we see that the vertical line test asserts that is the graph of a function if it passes the -test for all vertical lines in ; and conversely, is not the graph of a function if fails the -test for some vertical line in .  Let's see how this plays out with the graph of equation . As illustrated in , there are three qualitatively different ways in which a given vertical line can intersect with .   If the line lies strictly to the left or right of , then does not intersect with at all, and hence passes the -test.    If the line is one of the two vertical lines or , then intersects in exactly one point, and hence passes the -test.    Lastly, if lies strictly between the lines and , then intersects in exactly two points, and thus fails the -test.   Since fails the -test with respect to some vertical line ( , the line ), we conclude by that is not the graph of a function.   Vertical line test:   Vertical line test applied to circle      Vertical line test  It might be helpful to envision the vertical line test as a scanning procedure. Imagine scanning your set with a device that produces a vertical green line that we move from left to right across the entire expanse of .   If at some moment while we are scanning from left to right our green vertical line hits two or more different points on the graph, then our scanner emits a loud error beep, indicating that has failed an -test, and declares that is not the graph of a function.    If, on the other hand, we are able to scan the entire expanse of from left to right without hearing the error beep, then has passed the -test for all vertical lines , and the scanner declares that is the graph of a function.      By way of illustration we apply the vertical line test to a set already known to be the graph of a function.   Vertical line test: radical function   Let and let be the graph of , as depicted in .   Suppose the line has equation , where . How many points lie in the intersection of and . Does pass the -test for this line ?    Suppose the line has equation with . How many points lie in the intersection of and . Does pass the -test in for this line ?    What do (1) and (2) imply in regards to passing the vertical line test or not? Explain.          Graphically, for such lines , we see that intersects in exactly one point. In more detail, if has equation with , then intersects at the point . We conclude that passes the -test for such a line .    If has equation with , then we see graphically that does not intersect at all, and hence passes the -test.    Since the lines discussed in (1) and (2) cover all possible lines in , and since we saw that passes the -test for all these lines , we conclude by vertical line test that is the graph of a function.        Vertical line test: no intersection  Students are sometimes perplexed that if a vertical line does not intersect , then still passes the -test. is helpful in clearing up this confusion. There we see that the lines with equation that do not intersect are precisely those for which , the domain of . The observation holds more generally: if is the graph of a function , then a line with equation intersects in exactly one point if and does not intersect at all for if . This is because only contains points of the form , where .     Functions and relations  Yet another way of interpreting a function is as a binary relation (or just relation, for short). Loosely speaking, a binary relation is a property that either holds ( , is true) or does not hold ( , is not true) for a given pair of elements . When the property holds for we write . A familiar example of a binary relation from mathematics is furnished by the less than relation: we define to mean the real number is less than the real number , denoted in mathematical notation. For an example outside of mathematics, consider the binary relation defined as is a cousin of . In this case is true exactly when persons and are cousins.  A function gives rise to a binary relation in a natural way: namely, we can define the relation as is the value of at (or , for short). For example, the function defined as gives rise to the relation defined as , or in plainer English, is the square of . For example, in this case is true, since is the square of ( , ), but is not true since is not the square of ( , ).  Thus, we see that every function can be thought of as a certain binary relation. As with the situation with graphs of equations, however, not every relation arises from a function in this way. What makes relations arising from functions special is the defining property of a function: namely, that for every input of a function , there is exactly one output . As a consequence a relation is of the form for some function if and only if for every there is at most one such that is true. This is just a logical analogue of the vertical line test!  We will say that a relation  defines as a function of if there is a function such that is true if and only if is in the domain of and . From our discussion above, it follows that a relation defines as a function of if and only if for every there is at most one such that is true.  Consider again the relation defined as is a cousin of . This relation does not define as a function of since it is possible for a person to have more than one cousin.   Relations and functions   Decide whether the given relation defines as a function of .    is defined as is a square root of . (Here and are assumed to range over .)     is defined as is a nonnegative square root of . (Here and are assumed to range over .)     is defined as is the phone number of . (Here ranges over humans, and ranges over all possible phone numbers.)     is defined as is the phone number of . (Here ranges over all possible phone numbers, and ranges over all humans.)          Note that both and are true, since and are both square roots of . Thus it is not the case that for all there is at most one such that is true. We conclude that this relation does not define as a function of .    In this case the relation does define as a function of . This is because for each real number there is at most one nonnegative square root. More explicitly, defining , we see that is true if and only if .    The given relation does not define as a function of for the simple reason that a person can have more than one phone number!    The answer here is perhaps somewhat debatable. If we agree that a given phone number can belong to at most one person, then arises from the function defined as follows: given a (registered) phone number , is the owner of phone number .  Why is this debatable? Well, for one thing, in the era before mobile phones, households were equipped with a single phone (called a land line ), and the case could be made that that number was owned by all the people in the household. Thus, if we want to make a function out of this example, we would have to take more care to define what it means for a phone number to belong to a user.  This discussion is meant to be amusing, but is not entirely idle. It is often the case that a proposed function turns out upon closer inspection to not be well defined. Indeed, something very similar went wrong with the proposed function in .         Modeling with functions  Now that we have taken our first confident strides down the path of function exploration, you may be wondering why the study of functions is so important in the first place. The short answer is that functions are one of the most fundamental tools for modeling empirical phenomena. Scientific inquiry will often begin by treating one empirical quantity as being determined or dependent on some other empirical quantity (or even multiple quantities in a multivariable model ). In this situation it is natural to model the quantity as a function of these other quantities: , we assume there is a function satisfying (or in a multivariable model). Here are some typical examples.   We can model the vertical velocity of a skydiver in free fall as a function of the time elapsed since the diver jumped from the plane. In this case we assume for some function .    We can model the atmospheric temperature as a function of altitude . In this case we assume for some function .    We can model the yearly sales of a certain product as a function of its price and the yearly amount the producer spends on advertising. In this case we assume for some (multivariable) function .   Observe how in these modeling situations the defining characteristic of a function , that each input has a unique output , captures our intuitive idea of one quantity being dependent on another. Indeed, this is what motivates the language of dependent and independent variables introduced in . leads you through a simplified simulation of how scientists proceed from observations of physical phenomena to a full-fledged mathematical model. You are encouraged to explore that exercise on your own.  In the meantime, we end this first section by giving a preview of what calculus is, and how it plays an important role in empirical modeling. In short, calculus is the science of functions. It provides us powerful tools to study properties of functions. What kind of properties of functions are we interested in determining? Continuing with the empirical modeling context, suppose we are modeling quantity as a function of quantity ( , quantity is dependent on, or determined by quantity ). Here are some natural questions about we are interested in when studying the function that articulates the relation between and .   Maximum\/minimum values  Is there a maximum value of that can be attained? Is there a minumum value? In terms of , we are asking whether has a maximum and\/or minimum value. If it does, we would also like to know which inputs give rise to these maximum and minimum values.    Asymptotic values\/asymptotic behavior  Perhaps does not reach a maximum value. Does it approach some maximum value as varies, without ever attaining that value? Suppose quantity ranges naturally over the set of all nonnegative numbers: how does the output vary as gets infinitely large?    Increasing\/decreasing  How do the values change as we vary ? More specifically, does increase as we increase ? Does decrease as we increase ?    Average\/instantaneous rates of change  Fix a particular value of our quantity , and let be the value of corresponding to that input. How does change as we vary by arbitrarily small amounts about . More specifically, call the average rate of change with respect to as we vary from to . What happens to these average rates of change if we keep fixed, and pick to be arbitrarily close to . Do they approach a well-defined instantaneous rate of change ?   All the questions above can be phrased as questions about the function that models the relation between and , and we will be able to answer all of these questions, using calculus, by the end of this course!    Modeling a draining tank    depicts a water tank in the shape of a circular cone (with tip pointed downward). The height of the tank is 4 meters, and its circular top has a radius of 2 meters. The tank contains an initial quantity of water that steadily drains through a regulated valve at the bottom.   A draining conical tank    Once the draining begins we record at each subsequent minute the measurements of the height (in meters), radius (in meters), and volume (in cubic meters) of the conical body of water remaining in the tank. These are summarized in .   Measurements of a draining water tank     (min)  0  1  2  3  4    (m)  3  2.5  2  1.5  1    (m)  1.5  1.25  1  0.75  0.5    (m )  7.1  4.1  2.1  0.9  0.3     It is evident that at any time since the draining has begun, the height, radius, and volume of the remaining water have determinate values. Thus we have well-defined functions , , and that output the height, radius, and volume of the remaining water minutes after draining has begun.   What is an appropriate domain for the functions ? Our table only provides values of the functions for . Does this mean we should set ? (There is not one correct answer here.)    Focus on the measurements of the height of the remaining water. How does the height change with each passing minute? Conjecture a formula for the function .    The table suggests a relation between the height and radius of the remaining water at any given time. Express this relation as an equation involving and . (This relation can in fact be proven using similar triangles, but you need not do this here.) Assuming your conjectured formula for is correct, derive a formula for .    The volume formula for cylinders tells us that . Assuming your conjectured formula for is correct, compute a formula for . Assess the accuracy of your formula by comparing its outputs with .   This conical volume formula is nontrivial, and in fact its derivation requires some sophisticated calculus techniques: techniques you will be equipped with by the end of this course!     You have now modeled the various quanties associated to the remaining water with the functions . Assess whether your model gives a sensible answer to the following question: what is the volume of the remaining water 10 minutes after the draining has begun? What, in the face of the evidence given by , is a plausible answer to this question. What is a natural way of adjusting your model so that it provides this answer?            Based on the graphs of and below, answer the following questions. If a question has more than one answer, fill in your answer as a list of values separated by commas. Thus for example if you think when , when , and when , you would enter 20, 25, 29 (or any other order of these three numbers separated by commas).

The -coordinate of the point on the graph of (the dashed line) when is . Similarly, the -coordinate of the point on the graph of (the dashed line) when is . (c) There are three points on the graph of which have a -coordinate of 2.9: , and . (d) Two functions are equal when their graphs intersect.

For example according to the table values below there were $60.2 billion worth of $50 bills in circulation.

There was a total number of billion $10 bills in circulation.  c) Are the following statements True or False?   There were more 1 dollar bills than 5 dollar bills    There were more 5 dollar bills than 10 dollar bills               SOLUTION a) because when the entry in the top row is 10 , the corresponding entry below it is 14.8. b) The value 14.8 from part (a) indicates the total value (in billions of dollars) of $10 bills in circulation, not the number of $10 bills. The total number (in billions) of $10 bills in circulation equals the total value in circulation, f(10) = 14.8, divided by 10 (the value of each $10 bill): c) Using the same logic as in (b) calculate the number of each bill in circulation by finding the total value in circulation, , and dividing by the value of the bill, . Then compare the number of each bill in circulation, , for the given values of in order to determine whether the statements are true or false.

Every minutes, more people have begun eating    hours after 5 PM there are people eating    minutes after 5 PM there are people eating    hours after 5 PM there are people eating    None of the above     SOLUTION a) The input 3 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM, and the output 11 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time. Thus the mathematical expression means there are 11 people eating at 5:03 PM. b) The output 26 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at a particular time (in minutes after 5 PM). Thus the mathematical expression means minutes after 5 PM there are 26 people eating. c) The input 26 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM. Thus the mathematical expression means there are people eating at 5:26 PM. d) The corresponds to the time (in number of minutes past 5 PM), and the output indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time. Thus the mathematical expression indicates there are people eating in the restaurant minutes past 5 PM. None of these statements explain this correctly, so the answer is None of the above.

To prove this claim, it remains only to show the reverse set inclusion: , that every nonnegative real number is an element of , or equivalently, that if , then we have for some . This in turn is equivalent to showing that if , then we can solve the equation for . Thankfully, this is not so difficult. Indeed, given any , the number satisfies . (Of course, is another solution to , but we only needed to provide one.) Putting it all together, we conclude that given any , we have , where . This shows that every nonnegative real number is an element of , and completes the proof that .   "

  "body": " Linear and quadratic functions    Functions Linear Functions  Functions Quadratic Functions     Learning Goals     Understand the definition of linear and quadratic functions.    Explore how the parameters of a linear or quadratic function change the shape of its graph and its properties.    Use the different forms for equations for lines.    Solve quadratic equations via factoring or the quadratic formula.       Definitions of linear and quadratic functions  Part of our exploration of functions in this course will include the study of important families of functions. In this section we introduce two such families: linear functions and quadratic functions . These functions will serve as a useful starting point for two reasons: on the one hand, they are fairly simple functions and hence easy to analyze; on the other hand, these functions are widely used in real-world applications. For example, in statistics, the method of linear regression seeks to find a line that best describes the relationship between quantities that appear to change at a constant rate relative to each other; and quadratic functions are used in mechanics to model the height of an object falling under the force of gravity. We will explore several models that use linear and quadratic functions in after we develop our mathematical understanding of them.  We begin with the mathematical definitions of linear and quadratic functions. Recall that a mathematical definition is \"used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not.\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Definition accessed August 4, 2022. Thus the definitions below give us the precise meaning of a linear or quadratic function. Remember that we generally need a few examples to make sense of definitions, and these follow below each of the definitions.    Henceforth, unless specified otherwise, all functions in this course will be assumed to be of the form , where . In other words, by default, the inputs and outputs of functions in this course are assumed to be real numbers.     Linear functions   A function is linear (or affine ) if there are real constants and such that for all in its domain.     Linear functions   Verify that the given function is linear using .                             It follows immediately that is linear. Here and .    We have for all in the domain of . Thus is linear with and .    We have . Thus is linear with and .    We have for all . Thus is linear with and .        Standard form  As illustrated by , a function can be linear even if its given formula does not look precisely like the form in . Often we need to manipulate the given formula algebraically in order to bring it into the standard form prescribed by .    included to important types of linear functions that deserve their own definition: the identity function and constant functions .   Identity function and constant functions      A function is an identity function if for all in its domain.    A function is a constant function if there is a real constant such that for all in its domain.       We now move on to quadratic functions , which are only slightly more complicated than linear functions.   Quadratic function   A function is quadratic if there are real constants with such that for all in its domain.     Quadratic functions  Why do we insist that in ? This is to distinguish linear functions as a separate family from quadratic functions. If we allowed in our definition of quadratic functions then a linear function would also be quadratic, since for all in its domain.   As with linear functions, we sometimes need to do a little algebraic work to show that a given quadratic function has a formula of the standard form represented by .    Verify that the given function is quadratic using .                        We have , showing that is quadratic.    We have .        Parameters  It is important to note that when we write an expression like or , only is being treated as a variable. The extra letters , and that are not variables are called parameters of the function. How should you think about these parameters and what they represent?  While the word parameter may be new to you, the concept is probably not so unfamiliar. We can think of a parameter as a \"dial\" on the function machine. Setting the dials to different values creates different functions. Analogy and Image from https:\/\/mathinsight.org\/function_machine_parameters      Machine analogy for functions and parameters    Function visualized as machine turning inputs into outputs     Parameters visualized as adjustment dials on function machine      Consider the general form of a linear function: . Here is the independent variable that is allowed range over all elements of the domain of , whereas the constants and are parameters.   If we choose a specific value of and ( set the dials ), we get a specific function. For example, if and we get the linear function .    As we change the parameters and ( adjusting the dials ), we get different linear functions with different properties.   Thus, when we give a general form of a linear function in terms of unspecified parameters and , we are really presenting an entire family of functions : we get one linear function for each choice of the parameter values and .   Desmos: family of linear functions   The Desmos interactive in illustrates what effect the parameters and defining a linear function have on the graph of this function.   Play around with the values of and . Identify what graphical property each parameter represents.    Can you find values of that represents a horizontal line? Can you find values of that represents a vertical line? If so, what are they? If not, why not?      Desmos interactive : adjusting parameters of linear functions      Similarly, the general form of a quadratic function gives rise to an entire family of functions, one for each choice of the parameters . The graphical effect of these parameters on a quadratic function is explored in . As you will see, the relationship between the parameters and the graph is not as straightforward as it is for linear functions.   Desmos: family of quadratic functions   The Desmos interactive in explores what effect the parameters have on the graph of a quadratic function of the form .   Note that the graphs of quadratic functions are always parabolas. What detail about the parameters determines whether this parabola opens up or down?    How does the parameter affect the graph of the function?      Desmos interactive : adjusting parameters of quadratic functions        Properties of linear functions  Before drilling down more in our analysis of linear and quadratic functions, we give a formal definition of various properties of functions that we will be interested in studying.   Properties of functions   Let be a function with domain .   Zeros and -intercepts  A zero (or root ) of is an element satisfying . An -intercept of is a point on the graph of of the form . Thus each zero of gives rise to an -intercept on the graph of , and vice versa. Graphically speaking, an -intercept is a point where the graph of intersects the -axis.    -intercept  Assume . The -intercept of is the point on the graph of . Graphically speaking, the -intercept is the point where the graph of intersects the -axis.    Positive\/negative  Let be an interval. We say is positive (resp., negative ) on , denoted (resp., ), if (resp., ) for all . Similarly, is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive ) on , denoted (resp., ), if (resp., ) for all .  Graphically speaking, is positive on if points of lie above the -axis for all . Similar statements apply for negative, nonnegative, and nonpositive.    Increasing\/decreasing  Let be an interval. We say is increasing on if for all , if , then . Similarly, we say is decreasing on if for all , if , then .  Graphically speaking, if is increasing (resp. decreasing) on then the graph of moves up (resp. down) as we move to the right.    Maximum\/minimum  Let and let . We say has a maximum at relative to if for all . In this case we call the maximum value of on . Similarly, we say has a minimum at relative to if for all , and in this case we call the minimum value of on .  A maximum (resp. minumum) of relative to the entire domain is called a global maximum (resp. global minimum ) of , and in this case is called the global maximum value (resp. global minimum value ) of .  Graphically speaking, has a maximum (resp., minimum) at if the point is the highest (resp., lowest) point on the graph of with -coordinate in .       Let's test out some of this new terminology on some linear functions.   Linear function properties   For the given function do the following: (a) find all - and -intercepts, (b) determine the intervals on which is positive, negative, increasing, and decreasing, (c) find all inputs where has a global maximum or minumum (if any). The Desmos interactive in may be helpful.                    Three linear functions    Graph of   Graph of f(x)=-2x+3      Graph of   Graph of f(x)=3x+5      Graph of   Graph of f(x)=-2            The -intercept of is easily computed as . To find the -intercept(s) of , we solve the equation : . We conclude that has exactly one zero (or root), and hence exactly only -intercept, .  Looking at the graph of , we see that the function is decreasing on every interval : in plain English, the graph of  always moves down as we move to the right.  Since has a unique zero at and is decreasing on , it follows that is positive on the interval and negative on the interval .  Moreover, it follows from being decreasing on that it has no global maximum or minimum value. Roughly speaking, given any input , the value of will be greater than for inputs to the left of , and less than for inputs to the right. More formally, if we choose any with , then since is decreasing everywhere we have ; similarly, if we choose any with , we have . Thus has neither a global maximum nor global minimum at . Since was arbitrary, there is no input where has a global maximum or minimum.    Reasoning along the same lines as in (a), we find that the -intercept of is and there is a unique -intercept at corresponding to the unique solution of the equation .  Moreover, the function is increasing on every interval , from whence it follows that is negative on the interval and positive on the interval .  Lastly, since is increasing on , it follows that has no global maximum or minimum value, and thus no input where it has a global maximum or minimum.    Our answers for the constant function are qualitatively very different from those in (a) and (b). As always, the -intercept of is easily computed as , since for all inputs . However, in this case there are no -intercepts. Algebraically, this is a result of the fact that for all , and hence that we cannot have for any . Graphically, this is reflected in the fact that the graph of , the horizontal line , does not intersect the -axis.  Since the value of is equal to for all inputs, we see that is always negative and never positive. Furthermore, over any interval , since the value of on is constant, it is neither increasing nor decreasing. Finally, we see that is both the global maximum and global minimum value of : a trivial result of its being the only value of ! Since for all , it follows that has a global maximum and global minimum at every element in its domain!       Our analysis of the three linear functions in easily generalizes to the family of all linear functions, as we now make official.   Properties of linear functions   Let be defined as , where and are real constants.   The -intercept of is .    If , then has a unique zero at , and hence a unique -intercept at .    If , then is increasing on every interval ; if , then is decreasing on every interval ; if , then is constant on every interval , and hence is never increasing or decreasing.       As illustrated by all of our examples, the graph of a linear function is a line in . Why is this so? Recall from our discussion in that the graph of the function is the same thing as the graph of the equation , which we recognize as the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line. In we recall some of the different forms of equations of lines in the plane.   Equations of lines   Let be a line in the plane .  A general form of is any equation of the form , where , , and are real constants, and is the graph of . Every line in the plane has a general form.  Assume now that is not a vertical line.   Slope  The slope of is the constant defined as , where and are any two distinct points on .    Point-slope form  A point-slope form of is an equation of of the form , where is any point on , and is the slope of .    Slope-intercept form  The slope-intercept form of is the unique equation of of the form , where is the slope of and is a constant.        Equations of lines  As suggested by , a line in does not have a single defining equation, but rather many different equations of varying form. Some comments are in order.   The general form of a line is useful theoretically, as any line in can be defined in this manner. In particular, vertical lines , have defining equations in general form (namely, ), but no defining equation in slope-intercept or point-slope form.    The slope of a line is only defined for non-vertical lines. The fact that it can be computed as , where and are any two distinct points on is evidence of a certain regularity that lines satisfy. Indeed, letting and , we see that is the ratio of the change in to the change in between any two points on . The fact that this ratio does not depend on the choice of points means that starting from any point , as we move to the right on any positive distance , we move vertically by a directed distance of . We summarize this observation by saying that the slope computes the \"rise over run\" of the line : .    The slope-intercept form of a non-vertical line is useful, as we can read off the slope and -intercept directly from the equation. Furthermore, unlike the other equation forms of a line, the slope-intercept form is unique . As a consequence, we can distinguish two lines simply by looking at their slope-intercept forms (assuming both lines are non-vertical).    By contrast, the point-slope form of a non-vertical line is not unique. Indeed, though the parameter appearing in such an equation is unique (being the slope of the line), the constants and are not unique since they can be chosen as the - and - coordinates of any point on the line.  That said, it is precisely this non-uniqueness that makes the point-slope form so useful. As illustrated in , as soon as we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of any point on the line, we can derive a point-slope form. Furthermore, if desired, we can always easily derive the slope-intercept form from the point-slope form using a little algebra. (See .)      Two common ways of specifying a line in is either by specifying its slope and providing a point, or by specifying two distinct points on . The procedure below describes how to derive a point-slope form of the line in each of these situations.   Equations of lines   Let be a non-vertical line in the plane. Depending on the given information, we can derive a point-slope form of as follows.   If the slope of is known, and a point is given, then is a point-slope form of . If desired, the slope-intercept form can then be derived as .    If two points and on are given, then the slope of can be computed as , and a point-slope form of can be derived as , using the point , or , using .  As above, if desired, the slope-intercept form of can be derived algebraically from either of these two point-slope forms.        Equations of lines   Find both a point-slope form and the slope-intercept form for the given line. Recall that two lines in parallel in if and only if they have the same slope, and perpendicular if and only if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.    is the line with slope that passes through the point .     is the line that passes through the points and .     is the line passing through that is parallel to the line .     is the line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line .          Using the point-slope formula with slope and point , we get the equation . To derive the slope-intercept form, we simply distribute: .    The slope of the line through the points and is . From the slope and the point we derive the point-slope form . We then derive the slope-intercept form as . Note that using the other point would yield a different point-slope form , which can then be brought into the same slope-intercept form as above with a little algebra.    The line with equation can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as , and thus has slope . Since the line is parallel to this line it also has slope . Since it passes through the point , has point-slope form , and thus slope-intercept form .    The line we are looking for is perpendicular to and thus has slope . Using the point-slope form with slope and point , we obtain the equation . As above, a little algebra then reveals the slope-intercept form .        Checking the Answer  To verify that the three linear functions we just found are reasonable, we can graph them with a graphing utility (such as Desmos). In particular, let's graph the lines (red) and (green) in part c to make sure they appear to be perpendicular:   Notice that the scales on the - and -axes are the same, so the lines correctly appear as perpendicular. Additionally, we can see that the point is on the line .     Vertex form  In exploring properties of quadratic functions, we are naturally led to two useful algebraic techniques: solving quadratic equations (by factoring or using the quadratic formula) and completing the square.  Given a quadratic function of the form , in order to find its roots and -intercepts, we need to solve the equation . describes a systematic procedure for solving such equations. The validity of that technique relies on two important results about real number algebra that are deserving of their own official statements.   Zero product   Given , we have if and only if or . Using logical notation: . In plain English, a product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of the numbers is equal to zero.     Logical notation  The previous theorem sneaks in an important notion from logic, the if and only if connector, along with its double-headed, double-barreled arrow notation . In general, given propositions and , the compound statement if and only if , written using logical notation as means that proposition is true exactly when proposition is true. More formally, this means the statements are logically equivalent .  Logical equivalence, along with its logical notation , is intimately related to the notion of logical implication , and its notation . The statement implies or if , then , written , is the assertion that if proposition is true, so is proposition .  Mark well that the logical equivalence statement is stronger than the logical implication statement . More precisely, to assert is equivalent to asserting that two implications hold: and . This exlains why we use the double-headed arrow to denote logical equivalence: asserts a two-way implication between and .   As simple and intuitive as the statement of may seem, it plays an absolutely crucial role in algebra. Namely, it is the basis of the factoring technique for solving equations. Let's see why. Suppose we manage, after some factoring, to derive an equation of the form . According to , since the product of the two numbers and is zero, we must have . Solving both of these linear equations separately and preserving our or connector, we conclude that .   Factoring technique  The zero appearing in is absolutely essential. draws no conclusions from a factored equation of the form where . For example, consider the factored equation . Observing that , you might be tempted to conclude that since we must have , and hence . However, there is absolutely no justification for this step, and indeed the conclusion is false! Neither nor is a solution of the equation , as is easily verified by evaluating at each of these values: . This illustrates why, when solving an equation using factoring, we must always begin by bringing the equation into a form where one side is equal to zero. Continuing with the given equation, we proceed as follows: . Now we have an equation to which applies. We conclude that , and hence that .   The second important property from real number algebra we need to recall is none other than the quadratic formula .   Quadratic formula   Consider the equation , where and .   Equation has a real number solution if and only if .    Assume . The solutions to are , or for short.        Quadratic formula and discriminant  Note that supplies more than just a formula: the first part of the theorem tells us whether or not a given quadratic equation has a real solution. As asserted there, this depends on whether the constant , called the discriminant of the quadratic expression , is nonnegative.  In particular, it tells us that the corresponding equation has no real solution if . A classic example of this is furnished by the equation . After bringing this equation into the form , we see that the discriminant is . Since , implies that this equation, and hence also the equation , has no real solution. Of course, this just reaffirms the fact that does not have a real square root.   As you may already know, although does not have a real square root, we can expand the reals to a larger number system, called the complex numbers , in which does have a square-root. This is the origin of the famous imaginary number satisfying .    We have now laid out the necessary groundwork for the following general procedure for solving quadratic equations.   Solving quadratic equations   Consider a quadratic equation of the form . To solve this equation for , proceed as follows.   Use algebra to bring all terms to the left side (using addition\/subtraction) and zero on the right side, obtaining an equation of the form .    If possible, factor the left side of by hand to obtain an equation of the form , where , , , and are constants. Conclude that the solutions of are . If factoring by hand is difficult, solve using the quadratic formula as follows.   Compute the discriminant . Equation has a solution if and only if .    If , then the solutions of are given as .          Let's put to work with a variety of quadratic equations. As you will see, quadratic equations come in a number of different varieties, and each distinct variety lends itself to a particular variation of . Make sure to look at the solutions below, where we point out these different varieties and recall some factoring tricks.   Quadratic equations   Find all (if any) solutions to the given equation.                             We will solve this equation in two different ways.  First observe that the absence of a term involving in the equation allows us to solve just using the principal square root function: . You of course get the same answer by writing the equation as and using the quadratic formula, but our method above is quicker. As such, keep an eye out for quadratic equations lacking a term involving .  Alternatively, writing the equation as , when can solve by factoring, noting that the left side is an instance of a difference of squares and using the general difference of squares formula . Using this technique, we solve as follows: . Moral: keep an eye out for quadratic expressions that are difference of squares; they factor easily!    We solve the equation by factoring: . What made the factoring easy here was the fact that each term in the expression includes a factor of . The factoring method here is thus a sort of reverse distribution method, since the equality if read from right to left ( , in reverse), is just an assertion of the distributive property .  Again, we could have also used the quadratic formula to solve the equation. That method would proceed as follows: . Would you agree the first method is simpler?    First write the equation as . Applying the quadratic formula here is not too difficult. We get the solutions . The fact that the two solutions here are nice rational numbers ( , quotients of integers) suggests that our quadratic expression factors nicely. Indeed, taking a factoring approach, we solve the equation as follows: . The factoring step was accomplished using what might be deemed a reverse FOIL method. Here we try and find constants such that the factored expression expands out to when using FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last). For this to be the case we need to satisfy . The first two equations suggest that we play around with (positive and negative) integer factors of and , which leads to our factorization. For a refresher of this technique, see this Purplemath article or this Khan Academy video .    After trying in vain to factor the quadratic expression , we make use of . The discriminant of this expression is . Since , we conclude that the equation has no real solutions.       Let's officially record some of the factoring tricks employed in the solution to and variations thereof.   Quadratic factoring identities   Let .   Difference of squares       Binomial square       Distribution          Now that we have a good command of solving quadratic equations, let's apply this knowledge to the analysis of quadratic functions.   Quadratic function properties   Let .   Compute the -intercepts of .    Decide whether is an element of .    Compute .          We solve the equation using the reverse FOIl factoring technique: . We conclude that the roots of are and , and hence that the -intercepts of are and .    Using , we have if and only if there is an (the domain of ) satisying . In other words, if and only if we can solve the equation . Following we first bring the equation into standard form: . After a few failed attempts of factoring the right side of the above equation by hand, we make use of . The discriminant of is . Since , we conclude that the equation has no solutions! Following our logic backwards, this means there is no satisfying , and hence that is not in the range of .    The logic used in (b) can be generalized to answer this question. Namely, a real number is an element of if and only if we can solve the equation . Let's investigate this equation: . For which values of does the last equation have a solution? The quadratic formula tells us that this has a solution if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative. We now solve the elementary inequality for : . Following our logic, we conclude that has a solution if and only if , and hence that if and only if . This shows that , the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to .   We have made use here of some techniques for solving inequalities: namely that an inequality is preserved when adding a constant to both sides of the inequality, or when multiplying both sides by a positive number. We will give a thorough treatment of solving inequalities in .   Verify our claim graphically using . In more detail, enter the quadratic function into the Desmos interactive using the sliders and see why the resulting graph of indicates that .       The quadratic formula played a crucial role in the fairly thorough analysis of the function in . Can we produce a similar analaysis that applies to the entire family of quadratic functions, as opposed to a single example? Indeed, we can, and with another algebraic tool: the method of completing the square . Consider again the function treated in . Looking just at the first two terms of the formula for and taking into consideration the identity for the square of a binomial, we can re-write the formula for as . The funny step of adding and substracting 4 in the second line above was done solely to complete the nearly square expression to the square expression . Re-writing the formula for as in this manner is called completing the square, and the resulting new formula is called the vertex form of the function. What virtue is there in doing this? For one thing, the fact that , which cost us some effort to conclude in , is much easier to discern from the vertex formula. The key observation is that the term , being a square, is always nonnegative . This means that the value is always of the form plus some nonnegative value. We conclude that for all , and thus that . Moreover, we see that attains its minimum value of exactly when : , has a unique global minumum at , with minimum value .  Lastly, the algebra required to show that is simplified by our completed square formula: given any , we can solve for without invoking the quadratic formula as follows: . Note that our use of the radical here is justified by the fact that and hence .  Let's make official here this completing the square technique and the properties of quadratic functions the resulting vertex form immediately brings to light. We will revisit this technique in to deduce yet more properties of quadratic functions.   Properties of quadratic functions   Let , where and .   Vertex form (completing the square)  We have , where .    If , then and has a unique global minimum at , where and are as in .    If , then and has a unique global maximum at , where and are as in .        Completing the square  When completing the square for a quadratic expression, instead of commiting the formulas in to memory, it is advisable to factor out the constant first and complete the square on the resulting simpler quadratic expression whose leading term is equal to 1: .    Vertex form   Let .   Derive the vertex form for by completing the square.    Compute the range of .    Determine whether has a global minimum value and\/or a global maximum value.    Verify your answer using the Desmos interactive in .       Following we compute . From this vertex form for and , we see that and that attains a global maximum value of at . There is no global minimum value of since it attains all values in the infinite interval .  Using the interactive in , we produce a graph like the one in .

(click on the image to enlarge)          SOLUTION Since the function is linear, we can choose any two points (from the graph) to find its formula. We use the form to get the price of an apartment as a function of its height. We use the two points (10, 205000) and (20, 275000). We begin by finding the slope Next, we substitute a point into our equation using our slope of 7000 dollars per meter of height and solve for , the -intercept. We use the point ( 10, 205000): so . Therefore, .          Find the equation for the line (graphed in red) in the figure below.

Looking at the graph of , we see that the function is decreasing on every interval : in plain English, the graph of  always moves down as we move to the right.  Since has a unique zero at and is decreasing on , it follows that is positive on the interval and negative on the interval .  Moreover, it follows from being decreasing on that it has no global maximum or minimum value. Roughly speaking, given any input , the value of will be greater than for inputs to the left of , and less than for inputs to the right. More formally, if we choose any with , then since is decreasing everywhere we have ; similarly, if we choose any with , we have . Thus has neither a global maximum nor global minimum at .

Reasoning along the same lines as in (a), we find that the -intercept of is and there is a unique -intercept at corresponding to the unique solution of the equation .  Moreover, the function is increasing on every interval , from whence it follows that is negative on the interval and positive on the interval .  Lastly, since is increasing on , it follows that has no global maximum or minimum value, and thus no input where it has a global maximum or minimum.    Our answers for the constant function are qualitatively very different from those in (a) and (b). As always, the -intercept of is easily computed as , since for all inputs . However, in this case there are no -intercepts. Algebraically, this is a result of the fact that for all , and hence that we cannot have for any . Graphically, this is reflected in the fact that the graph of , the horizontal line , does not intersect the -axis.  Since the value of is equal to for all inputs, we see that is always negative and never positive. Furthermore, over any interval , since the value of on is constant, it is neither increasing nor decreasing.

  "body": " Equations of lines  As suggested by , a line in does not have a single defining equation, but rather many different equations of varying form. Some comments are in order.   The general form of a line is useful theoretically, as any line in can be defined in this manner. In particular, vertical lines , have defining equations in general form (namely, ), but no defining equation in slope-intercept or point-slope form.    The slope of a line is only defined for non-vertical lines. The fact that it can be computed as , where and are any two distinct points on is evidence of a certain regularity that lines satisfy. Indeed, letting and , we see that is the ratio of the change in to the change in between any two points on . The fact that this ratio does not depend on the choice of points means that starting from any point , as we move to the right on any positive distance , we move vertically by a directed distance of . We summarize this observation by saying that the slope computes the \"rise over run\" of the line : .    The slope-intercept form of a non-vertical line is useful, as we can read off the slope and -intercept directly from the equation. Furthermore, unlike the other equation forms of a line, the slope-intercept form is unique . As a consequence, we can distinguish two lines simply by looking at their slope-intercept forms (assuming both lines are non-vertical).    By contrast, the point-slope form of a non-vertical line is not unique. Indeed, though the parameter appearing in such an equation is unique (being the slope of the line), the constants and are not unique since they can be chosen as the - and - coordinates of any point on the line.  That said, it is precisely this non-uniqueness that makes the point-slope form so useful. As illustrated in , as soon as we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of any point on the line, we can derive a point-slope form. Furthermore, if desired, we can always easily derive the slope-intercept form from the point-slope form using a little algebra. (See .)     "

What made the factoring easy here was the fact that each term in the expression includes a factor of . The factoring method here is thus a sort of reverse distribution method, since the equality if read from right to left ( , in reverse), is just an assertion of the distributive property .

Use linear and quadratic functions to describe real-world problems.    Practice translating back and forth between the context and mathematical calculations in a problem.    Revisit ideas of domain and range, increasing and decreasing, intercepts, and average rate of change in a context that gives these concepts a practical meaning.       The Mathematical Modeling Process  A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.   below illustrates the process of mathematical modeling.   The modeling cycle. Graphic from www.educationaldesigner.org .    Given a real-world problem, our first task is to formulate a mathematical problem by   identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables    making assumptions that simplify the problem so it is easy enough to describe with mathematics    using knowledge of the physical situation to brainstorm relevant equations, formulas, and theorems, possibly working from data or a graph    obtaining equations that relate the variables     The second step is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that we will be developing over the year) to the mathematical equations that we have formulated in order to derive a mathematical solution.  In the third step, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don't compare well with reality, we need to refine our model or formulate a new model and start the cycle over again.  This is similar to the framework for problem-solving described in , except that in a truly real-world problem, the actual question may not be stated explicitly or formulated in a way that can be answered without further refinement of the question (getting more information, simplifying more assumptions, building more theory). Since we are working in the context of a calculus course, all of our \"real-world\" questions will be very well-behaved and tractable.  A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation. Instead, it is an idealization or an approximation . A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to realize the limitations of the model.    Average rate of change  In this section we will treat examples of modeling that use linear and quadratic functions. Important in this context is the question of why one of these types of functions would be more appropriate than the other in a given setting. One important difference between the two families of functions lies in the shape of their graphs: linear functions have linear graphs, whereas quadratic functions do not. (In fact the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, as we will discuss later.)  The notion of the average rate of change of a function provides us with a convenient algebraic way of articulating this difference between linear and quadratic functions.   Average rate of change   Assume the function is defined on the interval . The average rate of change from to (or over the interval ) is defined as .     Average rate of change  Some remarks are in order.   It is absolutely essential to note that the average rate of change of a function depends on the given interval. A function can possibly have one average rate of change on the interval and a different average rate of change on the interval .    Let be the dependent variable for a function , so that for all in the domain of . The average rate of change over an interval is a measure of how how quickly the the -values of change as we let the input vary over . Writing and , to evoke change in - and -values respectively, we sometimes use the shorthand . This notation effectively evokes the concept of a rate of change. Note, however, that some important information is hidden in the notation, since the specific interval in question is not indicated in the notation.    In a modeling situation, the independent and dependent variables and usually have units attached to them. Using some units algebra , the units of the average rate of change over an interval are given as , usually read as unit per unit . Making clear the units of an average rate of change often helps us understand the physical meaning of this measure in a modeling situation.    The average rate of change of a function over the interval is a somewhat coarse measure of how outputs of change with respect to inputs as it only makes use of the information provided by the outputs and at the endpoints of this interval. This measure remains silent about what happens in between: , it provides now information about how the function behaves on the open interval .      The notion of average rate of change gives us an alternative characterization of a linear function: namely, a function is linear if and only if its average rate of change is the same for any interval. We summarize this by saying that a linear function has a constant rate of change .   Linear function equivalence   Let be a function. The following statements are equivalent.    is linear.     has a constant rate of change ( , the average rate of change of is the same for any interval).   Moreover, given a linear function , where and are constants, the slope is the average rate of change of over any interval . In other words, is the (constant) rate of change of .    Since we are proving the logical equivalence (1) (2), we must show that (1) (2) and (2) (1). We show each implication separately.   Implication: (1) (2)  Assume is linear. By definition this means there are constants such that for all . We claim that is the average rate of change of over any given interval. This means in particular that the average rate of change of is constant over any interval. To prove the claim we take any interval , and compute the average rate of change of over as , as desired.    Implication: (2) (1)  Now assume that is a function whose average rate of change over any interval is always the same. Let be the value of this constant average rate of change. Furthermore, let . We claim that for all , and hence that is linear. To prove the claim, let be any positive real number and consider the interval . Since the average rate of change of over is equal to the constant , we have . Solving the equation above for , we conclude that . Similarly, if is any negative real number, then applying the same argument to the interval , we conclude again that . Lastly, since , we see that for all . This proves is linear.      Average rate of change: linear functions   Decide from the given information whether the function is linear. If so, provide a formula for . (Assume the domain of is .)    Table of values for    x -3 -1 1 3    f(x) 10 7 4 1        Table of values for    x 2 3 5 7    f(x) -5 -4 -3 -2             From the given information we see that the rate of change of is constant over any interval, and equal to . From we conclude that is linear and of the form for some . To determine , we can evaluate at any of the provided inputs and then solve for . Using the input , for example, we have . We conclude that . Note that although we were not asked to do so, we can easily check our answer by verifying that .    The function is not linear! Be careful, there was a slight trick involved here in that the -values included in the table are not incremented by a constant amount. That is pretty unconventional for a table, but not expressly prohibited. Computing the average rate of change of over the two intervals and we get . Since these average rates of change are not the same, we conclude that is not linear.         Using Linear Functions as Models  The new characterization of linear functions in makes clear the role of linear functions in modeling: we should chose a linear function as our model, when the output quantity changes at a constant rate with respect to the input quantity.   Dolbear's law   Dolbear's law relates the chirping of crickets to temperature.  You can read more in the Wikipedia entry for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets. For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see this article .  In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature. If we let represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.   Data for Dolbear's observations     (chirps\/min)  40  80  120  160     ( F)         For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. When we graph the data, we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use.   Graph of Dolbear's data relating rate of chirps (chirps\/min) and temperature ( F).   Graph of Dolbear's data     The data appear to fit a line, suggesting that can be modeled as a linear function of : , we have for some constants . According to , can be computed as the average rate of change of over any interval of our choosing. The points Using the points and on our graph allow us to compute the average rate of change of over as . Thus we have . Now evaluate this equation with any input\/output pair you like in order to solve for . Taking , for example we see that: .  Before we attempt any further calculations, we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data. Let's check that the point is indeed on the line. For , we have   Success! We conclude that Dolbear's function  models the relationship between the number of cricket chirps per minute and the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.      Now that we have a model for Dolbear's observations, let's use it to make some predictions.   If we hear snowy tree crickets chirping at a rate of 92 chirps per minute, what does Dolbear's model suggest should be the outside temperature?    If the outside temperature is F, how many chirps per minute should we expect to hear?    Suppose that in the morning an observer hears 65 chirps per minute, and several hours later hears 75 chirps per minute. How much has the temperature risen between observations?        Dolbear's law: continued   Let's continue to explore the limits of our model for Dolber's observations. Suppose we wish to know the number of chirps we should hear when the outside temperature is F. There is no point on the graph with and so we solve numerically for to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is F.   In context, this means that when it's outside, we should hear chirps per minute. A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense, and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is F.  At this point in the modeling process, a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations. Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above F are too hot for the crickets, so the model is only accurate for temperatures between F and F. Recalling that here we are modeling temperature as a function of the rate of chirping , we see that for our model to be meaningful, we want (set of outputs ) to lie in . Since our function is linear, this means we must restrict the domain (possible inputs) accordingly. First let's solve the equations and for : . Since is an increasing function of , it follows that if we want , we need to pick the domain of to be .     Domains of modeling functions  When working with a model, it is common to have to restrict the domain of a function based on real-world conditions, rather than algebraic requirements, so that the model makes sense in the context it is meant to represent.   Here is another physical phenomenon where a linear function provides an appropriate model: measuring the area of a glacier over time. Remember: linear functions have constant average rates of change, so are ideal for modeling quantities that change at a constant rate.   Modeling Glacier Areas   The summit of Africa's largest peak, Mt. Kilimanjaro, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak. Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 ( ) to be approximately m ; in the year 2007, the ice cover measured m .   Suppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year. Find a linear model whose output is the area, in square meters in year (where is the number of years after 2000).    What do the slope and -intercept mean in the model you found in (a)? In particular, what are the units on the slope?    Compute . What does this quantity measure? Write a complete sentence to explain.    If the model holds further into the future, when do we predict the ice cover will vanish?    In light of your work above, what is a reasonable domain to use for the model ? What is the corresponding range?          We are told that the ice cover starts at , so the point lies on the graph of the function. We are also given the point . The slope is then The linear model is then .    The slope is the rate at which the glacier is losing ice each year, measured in m \/year. The -intercept is the area of the ice at (in 2000).     . In 2017, the ice cover on the glacier is approximately 989.2857 m .    The ice cover will vanish when . Solving for , we have . The ice cover will vanish toward the end of May of 2034.    A reasonable domain for the model is . The corresponding range is , meaning the ice cover will take on values between 1951 m and 0 m . (Note that we still write this interval as 0 to 1951 when using interval notation, even though the ice cover is vanishing.)         What is a quantity or phenomenon that you observe to have a constant rate of change? Assign names to the independent and dependent variables and create a linear model of this phenomenon. If relevant, include an appropriate domain and\/or range. Is your model an increasing or decreasing linear function?      Modeling with quadratic functions: falling objects  One of the reasons that quadratic functions are so important is because of a physical fact of the universe we inhabit: for an object only being influenced by gravity, acceleration due to gravity is constant . If we measure time in seconds and a rising or falling object's height in feet, the gravitational constant is feet per second per second, where the negative sign signifies that gravity is pulling \"down,\" meaning toward the ground.  One of the fantastic consequences of calculus which, like the realization that acceleration due to gravity is constant, is largely due to Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s is that the height of a falling object at time is modeled by a quadratic function.   Height of falling object   For an object tossed vertically from an initial height of feet with a velocity of feet per second, the object's height at time (in seconds) is given by the formula and corresponds to a gravitational constant of ft\/s .  If height is measured instead in meters and velocity in meters per second, the gravitational constant is m\/s and the function has form .    We will see where this formula comes from later in the course!   Water ballon   A water balloon is tossed vertically from a dorm room window at an initial height of 37 feet with an initial velocity of 41 feet per second.   Find a formula for the height of the ballon seconds after it is tossed.    When does the balloon hit the ground?    Use technology to produce a graph of , and use this to estimate the maximum height reached by the water balloon during its flight.          We can use Theorem to model the height of the water balloon. First, we notice that since the information is given in feet and seconds, we should use the formula corresponding to a gravitational constant of ft\/s . Next, we determine the constants in the formula. The initial height in the problem is given as 37 feet, so we have .  The initial velocity is given as 41 feet per second. Note the units! This is the rate of change of position. Thus we have .  Thus our model is where is measured in seconds, denotes the time at which the water balloon is thrown, and is measured in feet.    The balloon hitting corresponds to a time when . Thus, we wish to solve for , noting that we would like to have a positive time since our model only becomes valid after . That quadratic equation does not look like it will factor nicely, so we will immediately use the quadratic formula:   Since we are looking for a time after the balloon is thrown, the answer we are looking for is . This implies a domain for our model since the balloon cannot pass through the ground: the model gives the height of the water balloon seconds after it is thrown until it hits the ground, so for .    Lastly, let's graph our function and use that to estimate the time the water balloon reaches its highest point, along with its height at that time. This will give us the range of our model, as well.   The function that models the height of the water balloon for .    From the Desmos graph, we can see that the quadratic function reaches its maximum at approximately the point , and that the range of our modeling function is . Interpreting this information back into the context of the balloon, we can say that the balloon reaches its highest point approximately second after it is thrown, and that its height is feet at that time.  Note that we can verify these claims algebraically by computing a completed square form of our quadratic function. We have . From , we conclude that has a maximum at and its maximum value there is .         Use the model developed in Example to answer the following questions.   Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . What are the units for the number you computed?    Copy the graph of from to your notes. Draw an appropriate line on the graph whose slope is the value of the average rate of change in part (a).    You should have computed in part (a) and be able to see in part (b) that the average rate of change of on the interval is negative. Does this mean that the balloon is falling between and ?    Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . Is the balloon speeding up or slowing down as it approaches the ground?         Cost, Revenue, and Profit  In the business world the quantities of cost, revenue, and profit related to production of a good are of great importance. These quantities are often modeled as functions of the amount of the good produced.   Cost function   The cost function  gives the total cost of producing a quantity of some good.    What sort of function do you expect to be? The more goods that are made, the higher the total cost, so is an increasing function. Costs of production can be separated into two parts: the fixed costs, which are incurred even if nothing is produced, and the variable costs, which depend on how many units are produced.   Radio production: cost function   Let's consider a company that makes radios. The factory and machinery needed to begin production are fixed costs, which are incurred even if no radios are made. The costs of labor and raw materials are variable costs since these quantities depend on how many radios are made. The fixed costs for this company are $24,000 and the variable costs are $7 per radio. Then so, if is the number of radios produced, .    The variable cost for one additional unit is called the marginal cost . For a linear cost function, the marginal cost is the rate of change, or slope, of the cost function.    In each case, draw a graph of a linear cost function satisfying the given conditions:   Fixed costs are large but marginal cost is small.    There are no fixed costs but marginal cost is high.        Revenue Function   The revenue function , , gives the total revenue resulting from the production of a quantity of some good.    Let's assume that the price of our good is itself a function of the quantity of the good produced. Assuming further that the quantity of goods sold is equal to the quantity produced (not always a good assumption!), we conclude that revenue function is computed as . In the simplest case, the price is a constant, independent of the quantity of goods produced, in which case formula reduces to , modeling revenue as a linear function of . In this case, the graph of is a line passing through the origin with slope .   Radio production: revenue   If radios sell for $15 each, then the manufacturer's revenue function is      Radio production: cost and revenue   Graph the cost function and the revenue function on the same axes. For what values of does the company make money?    The company makes money whenever revenues are greater than costs, so we find the values of for which the graph of lies above the graph of :   We find the point at which the graph of and cross:   The company makes a profit if it produces and sells more than 3000 radios. The company loses money if it produces and sells fewer than 3000 radios.    This difference between the revenue and cost is called profit , and many decisions are made based on this quantity, rather than cost or revenue alone:   Profit function   Assume the production of a certain good has associated cost and revenue functions and , where is the quantity of good produced. The profit function , denoted is defined as . In other words, is the net profit (revenue minus cost) resulting from producing a quantity of the good.  The break-even point is the level of production resulting in a profit of zero: equivalently, this is the level of production where revenue equals cost.     Radio production: break-even point and fixed cost   For our radio manufacturer, a formula for the profit function is   Notice that in terms of the graph of , the fixed cost corresponds to the -intercept, and the break-even point corresponds to the -intercept.   Profit for the radio manufacturer.        If cost, , and revenue, , are given by the graph below, what is the break-even point for the company? For what production quantities does the firm make a profit?       Just as we used the term marginal cost to mean the rate of change, or slope, of a linear cost function, we use the terms marginal revenue and marginal profit to mean the rate of change, or slope, of linear revenue and profit functions, respectively. The term marginal is used because we are looking at how the cost, revenue, or profit change \"at the margin,\" that is, by the addition of one more unit.    For example, for the radio manufacturer, the marginal cost is 7 dollars\/item (the additional cost of producing one more item is $7), the marginal revenue is 15 dollars\/item (the additional revenue from selling one more item is $15), and the marginal profit is 8 dollars\/item (the additional profit from selling one more item is $8).      How is the idea of a \"marginal\" cost, revenue, or profit similar to the idea of the average rate of change of a function?         A town has a population of people at time . In each of the following cases, write a formula for the population , of the town as a function of year .  (a) The population increases by people per year.   people  (b) The population increases by percent a year.   people             (a) The function is linear with initial population of people and slope of , so . (b) This function is exponential with inital population of and growth rate of percent, so .          Let be time in seconds and let be the rate, in gallons per second, that water enters a reservoir:  (a) Evaluate the expression   (b) Which one of the statements below best describes the physical meaning of the value of ?   The rate, in gallons per second, at which the water is entering reservoir after 10 seconds.    The total amount, in gallons, of water in the reservoir after 10 seconds.    How many seconds until the water is entering to reservoir at a rate of 10 gallons per second.    The rate at which the rate of the water entering the reservoir is decreasing when 10 gallons remain in the reservoir.

After how many seconds the water stops flowing into the reservoir and starts to drain out.    The rate, in gallons per second, at which the water is initially entering the reservoir.    The initial amount of water, in gallons, in the reservoir.    The average rate, in gallons per second, at which water is flowing out of the reservoir.    (d) For , when does the reservoir have the most water?  When  sec.  (e) For , when does the reservoir have the least water?  When  sec.  (f) If the domain of is , what is the range of ?  range = (enter your answer in interval notation, or an inequality in : )         A    A    C   SOLUTION (a) . (b) means water is entering the reservoir at 250 gallons per second at time seconds. (c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time seconds, the water is initially flowing in at the rate of 600 gallons per second. The horizontal intercept tells us that at seconds, the flow has stopped. The slope is . This means that the rate at which water enters the reservoir decreases by 35 gallons per second each second. The water is flowing in at a decreasing rate. (d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, , is positive because water is being added. Water is being added until seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at , the most water is in the reservoir. (e) The reservoir has water draining out between and , but this amount is not as much as the water that entered between and . Thus, the reservoir had the least amount of water at the beginning when . Remember the function gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir. (f) If the domain is specified as , then the rate varies from 600 gallons per second at to -275 gallons per second at , so the range is . In interval notation we express the range as .          A report by the US Geological Survey indicates that glaciers in Glacier National Park, Montana, are shrinking. Recent estimates indicate the area covered by glaciers has decreased from over in 1850 to about in 1995.

You can read more in the Wikipedia entry for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets. For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see this article .  In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature. If we let represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.   Data for Dolbear's observations     (chirps\/min)  40  80  120  160     ( F)         For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. When we graph the data, we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use.   Graph of Dolbear's data relating rate of chirps (chirps\/min) and temperature ( F).   Graph of Dolbear's data     The data appear to fit a line, suggesting that can be modeled as a linear function of : , we have for some constants . According to , can be computed as the average rate of change of over any interval of our choosing. The points Using the points and on our graph allow us to compute the average rate of change of over as . Thus we have . Now evaluate this equation with any input\/output pair you like in order to solve for . Taking , for example we see that: .  Before we attempt any further calculations, we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data. Let's check that the point is indeed on the line. For , we have   Success! We conclude that Dolbear's function  models the relationship between the number of cricket chirps per minute and the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.   "

There is no point on the graph with and so we solve numerically for to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is F.   In context, this means that when it's outside, we should hear chirps per minute. A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense, and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is F.  At this point in the modeling process, a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations. Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above F are too hot for the crickets, so the model is only accurate for temperatures between F and F. Recalling that here we are modeling temperature as a function of the rate of chirping , we see that for our model to be meaningful, we want (set of outputs ) to lie in .

Find a formula for the height of the ballon seconds after it is tossed.    When does the balloon hit the ground?    Use technology to produce a graph of , and use this to estimate the maximum height reached by the water balloon during its flight.          We can use Theorem to model the height of the water balloon. First, we notice that since the information is given in feet and seconds, we should use the formula corresponding to a gravitational constant of ft\/s . Next, we determine the constants in the formula. The initial height in the problem is given as 37 feet, so we have .  The initial velocity is given as 41 feet per second. Note the units! This is the rate of change of position. Thus we have .  Thus our model is where is measured in seconds, denotes the time at which the water balloon is thrown, and is measured in feet.    The balloon hitting corresponds to a time when . Thus, we wish to solve for , noting that we would like to have a positive time since our model only becomes valid after . That quadratic equation does not look like it will factor nicely, so we will immediately use the quadratic formula:   Since we are looking for a time after the balloon is thrown, the answer we are looking for is . This implies a domain for our model since the balloon cannot pass through the ground: the model gives the height of the water balloon seconds after it is thrown until it hits the ground, so for .    Lastly, let's graph our function and use that to estimate the time the water balloon reaches its highest point, along with its height at that time. This will give us the range of our model, as well.   The function that models the height of the water balloon for .    From the Desmos graph, we can see that the quadratic function reaches its maximum at approximately the point , and that the range of our modeling function is . Interpreting this information back into the context of the balloon, we can say that the balloon reaches its highest point approximately second after it is thrown, and that its height is feet at that time.  Note that we can verify these claims algebraically by computing a completed square form of our quadratic function. We have .

Learning Goals     Learn the definition of power, polynomial and rational functions.    Review the algebraic rules for fractions and exponents.    Learn to distinguish between power, polynomial, and rational functions.       Power functions  We will begin with power functions. In its most general form, a power function is a function of the form , where and are real constants. The important defining detail here is that in the formula the input variable is raised to some fixed power : that is, in a power function, the input variable appears as the base in the power expression, and not the exponent. Later we will introduce exponential functions , which are also defined via a power expression, but where the input variable appears as the exponent, as opposed to the base.  As familiar as the function formula may seem, it takes significant meaning to give meaning to this for an aritrary power . For now we will settle for a a definition for rational powers : , for real numbers that can we written as , where and are integers. In other words, will give meaning to functions of the form , but not to functions of the form , or , since and (famously) are not rational numbers. We will eventually extend our definition of power functions to include such irrational powers, but to do so we will need the help of calculus.   Rational numbers    rational numbers    A real number is rational if it can be written as a quotient of two integers: , we have for some integers .  We denote by the set of all rational numbers: , .     Power functions: rational power   A power function (with rational power) is any function of the form , where and , and where the expression is defined below in a case-wise manner.   Zero power  We define for all .    Positive integer  If is a positive integer, then .    Odd -th root  If is a positive odd integer, then , where is the unique real -th root of .    Even -th root  If is a positive even integer, and then , where is the unique positive  -th root of .    Positive rational  If and are relatively prime positive integers Integers are relatively prime if they share no integer factors besides . This technical condition is here to ensure the definition is well defined. , then .    Negative rational  If and are relatively prime positive integers, then .       Looking carefully at the various cases that define for a rational power , we see that some restrictions on what can be have been snuck in. Namely, when is a positive even integer, we see that is only defined for nonnegative values of . Additionally, for negative rational powers , since by definition , we see that this expression is defined if and only if is defined and nonzero. As a consequence of these restrictions, we need to take care when computing the implied domain of a power function .   Power functions: implied domain   Determine the implied domain of the given power function.                             By definition, we have . Since is defined for all and equal to 0 exactly when , we see that the implied domain of is .    Since is an even positive integer, the expression is defined only on . It follows that the implied domain of is .    By definition, we have . Since is defined for all , and is defined for all , it follows that is defined for all . We conclude that the implied domain of is .    By definition, we have . Since is defined if and only if , and since if and only if , we see that is defined if and only if . For the expression to be defined, we need further that is nonzero. This adds the additional restraint that . We conclude that the implied domain of is .       To evaluate a power function at an input, we must make our way through the various cases in the definition of a power expression . Depending on the complexity of , we may at some point have to compute a reciprocal and\/or an -th root. Our ability to write down a nice -th root of some given value determines how nicely our computed value is expressed in the end.   Evaluating power functions   Evaluate the given power function at the given input .    ,      ,           We compute .    We compute .       As we combine power functions with other functions, we will want to be able to simplify expressions wherever possible. The following power identities will come in handy in this respect.   Power identities      Each equality below is true for all real numbers , , for which the expressions involved are defined.     Assume . The following equality is true for all real numbers and : .        Iterated powers  The restriction is indeed a necessary one for the identity . For example consider the choices . Using , we have . Thus in this case. This counterexample illustrates again the subtleties of our definition of a power expression : specifically, that when for a positive even integer, is defined as the positive square root of (assuming ).  Put another way, the failure of the identity to hold in the example is a consequence of the fact that the equality does not hold for all ; it is only true for . After we officially introduce the absolute value, we will prove an improved version of this identity that does hold for all real numbers: namely, .     Simplify each expression to one involving only positive exponents. You may assume all the identities of apply in each case.                             We compute .    We compute     We compute .    We compute .       The identities in are a convenient way to recall some identities involving radicals. As an example, below we translate certain instances of the identities from into radical notation using the definition : . We make this observation official in .   Radical identities   Assume and are nonnegative. The following equalities hold for all positive integers and . .    Notice that we say a function is a power function if it can be written in the form for some constants and ; it may not start out written that way. Sometimes it can take a great deal of algebra to determine whether or not a function is a power function \"in disguise.\"    For example, is the function a power function? If so, what are the numbers and ?    We can expand, factor, and then make a lucky cancellation to write this expression in the form :         PTX:ERROR: WeBWorK problem Library\/Rochester\/setAlgebra02ExponentsRadicals\/srw1_2_88-sol.pg with seed 17 does not have a statement tag Maybe it uses something other than BEGIN_TEXT or BEGIN_PGML to print the statement in its PG code Use -a to halt with returned content        Polynomial functions  Before giving the formal definition of a polynomial, let's take a look at some examples of what we will call polynomial functions: . We next make a list of some common features of these functions.   In contrast to linear and quadratic functions, these polynomials are seen to be sums of an unlimited (but finite) number of terms.    Each term is either constant or a number times a power of .    The power of is always a positive whole number, though the constant in front may be any real number whatsoever.   Lastly, we synthesize these observations in a formal definition.   Polynomials   A polynomial is a function that can be written in the form for some integer and real numbers . For each , is called the -th term of and is called its -th coefficient ; is called the constant term of .  Furthermore, if , then is called the leading term of , its leading coefficient , and its degree , denoted .     Constant, linear, quadratic functions  Observe that constant, linear, and quadratic functions are each members of the larger family of polynomials. In more detail, they are polynomials for which the appearing in is equal to , , or , as illustrated in .   Small degree polynomials     Type Formula    0 Constant    1 Linear    2 Quadratic ,     In this sense is a generalization of these earlier definitions. As such our parametric manner of understanding linear and quadratic (and constant) functions applies more generally to polynomials. In this more general setting, the coefficients appearing in the general formula function as parameters: by varying our choice of the coefficients , we get an infinite family of polynomials.    Zero function and zero polynomial  A function is called a zero function if for all . Observe that a zero function is also a polynomial according to . Indeed we have where . Because of this, zero functions are also called zero polynomials .  Since the formula for the zero polynomial has no nonzero coefficients, the notion of degree given in does not apply: , technically for us the zero polynomial does not have a degree. There is not a fast and fixed convention on this point in the mathematics literature: some texts declare the degree of the zero polynomial to be undefined; still others declare the degree of the zero polynomial to be !    Larger degree polynomials  Using the new language of degree, we see that quadratic functions are just polynomials of degree 2. We have similar names for polynomials of higher degree.   Polynomials of higher degree     Formula Degree Type     Quadratic     Cubic     Quartic     Quintic       Polynomials   Determine if the given function is a polynomial. If yes, determine the constant term of , and if applicable, the leading term, leading coefficient, and degree.                        As discussed in , all constant functions are polynomials (corresponding to the choice ). In this case the constant term of is . Since , this is also the leading term and leading coefficient of , and we have .    As discussed in , the zero function (or zero polynomial) is indeed a polynomial. However, since no nonzero coefficients appear in its formula, the notions of leading term, leading coefficient, and degree do not apply.    The given function is indeed a polynomial, though we need to do some algebra to recognize that it has a formula of the form : . Once in this form, we see that the constant term of is , its leading term is , its leading coefficient is , and its degree is .         For the polynomial , determine the leading coefficient, leading term, degree, constant term, and coefficients and .      Rational functions  Just as rational numbers are defined as quotients of integers, a rational function is defined as a quotient of polynomials.   Rational function   A function is a rational function if it can be expressed as a quotient of two polynomials: , is rational if there are polynomials and satisfying for all in the domain of .     Implied domain of rational function  Suppose is a rational function, where . Since and are defined for all , we see that the expression defining is defined as long as . Thus the implied domain of is . To compute , we need to be able to find the zeros of the denominator polynomial . It turns out that this is not always an easy task, especially if the degree of is large. We will provide techniques for doing this in the next section.   Just like our previous definitions for functions, the key realization is that a rational function can be written in such a form. It does not have to begin that way.   Rational function: like denominators   Verify that is a rational function by writing it as , where and are polynomials.    To express as a quotient of polynomials, we will convert the given formula of into a single quotient using the technique of like denominators . .     Rational function: clear denominators   Verify that is a rational function by writing it as , where and are polynomials.    We use the algebraic technique of clearing denominators : .     Fraction arithmetic  The examples above hopefully reactivated your fraction arithmetic skills. Let's summarize some of the definitions and techniques utilized.   Fraction arithmetic    Fraction multiplication     Multiplying by     Fraction addition with like denominators     Fraction addition via like denominators        Algebraic functions  A function is algebraic if it can be expressed in terms of constants and a variable by using only arithmetic operations , and and rational constant powers of the variables. For example, are algebraic functions.  There are four basic types of algebraic functions, which we have already investigated: linear functions, polynomial functions, rational functions, and power functions. More complicated algebraic functions can be constructed by using sums ( ), differences ( ), products ( ), and quotients ( ) of these four basic types. gives a general form and examples for each type:   A summary of algebraic functions    Type  General form  Examples    Linear   ,    Polynomial      Rational      Power  ,     Other  Arithmetic comb. of previous types  ,     There is a certain amount of overlap among the types listed in the table; for example, is both a power function and a polynomial function, and is both a power function and a rational function.  Functions that are not algebraic are called transcendental functions. In later chapters of this book, we will investigate four basic types of transcendental functions: exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. We will not go into their definitions or general forms right now. However, provides some examples.   A summary of transcendental functions    Type  Examples    Exponential     Logarithmic     Trigonometric     Inverse Trigonometric     Other       Identifying algebraic function types   For each function listed, determine whether it is a linear, power, polynomial, rational, algebraic or transcendental function. Some functions may satisfy more than one classification.                              is a power function of the form with real-number coefficient and rational-number exponent . Since , is also a rational function of the form with the polynomials and . Thus is an algebraic function that is both a power function and a rational function.    The function is not algebraic, because it involves a nonconstant exponent. Therefore the function also fails to be algebraic and thus is transcendental.     is a quotient of algebraic functions, but not a quotient of polynomials , since is not a polynomial. Therefore is an algebraic function, but not a rational function.    This function can be simplified: . After the last simplification it is easy to see that is also a polynomial function, with degree , and coefficients and . Furthermore, since we can write , is a rational function as well, with and . Therefore is an algebraic function that is linear, polynomial, and rational.         What is an example of a single algebraic function that is linear, polynomial, rational, and a power function (all of these at once). You have seen several          Is the function a power function?

Learning objectives     Determine the implied domain of power, polynomial and rational functions.    Explore graph properties of power, polynomial, and rational functions    Factoring polynomials and finding roots       Power functions  The properties of power functions are nicely summarized by their graphs. Let's look first at the graphs of power functions of the form , where is an integer.   Power functions: positive integer power       Graph of x squared        Graph of x cubed        Graph of x to the fourth        Graph of x to the fifth         Power functions: negative integer power       Graph of x to minus 2        Graph of x to minus 3        Graph of x to minus 4        Graph of x to minus 5        The eight graphs in and nicely illustrate how the precise nature of the power involved affects the properties of and its graph. In particular, we see that the general shape of the graph is determined by whether is positive or negative (the sign of ), and whether is even or odd (the parity of ). summarizes some observations about these power functions that are strongly suggested by our graphs. The claims there about domain are easily verified using the definition of power functions (see ). The claims about range can be shown to be true using , as illustrates.   Properties of ,     Sign of Parity of Domain of range of    even    odd    even    odd      Power function: range   Let , where is a positive even integer. Show that .    Since for some integer , we have , where the last inequality follows from the observation that the square of any real number is nonnegative. Since the outputs of are all nonnegative, we conclude . We now set about proving the reverse inclusion: . To this end, take any . Since , the number is well defined. (In this case, since is even, by definition is the unique nonnegative -th root of .) Setting , we have . This shows that is an output of , and thus that , as desired. We conclude that .    Power functions of the form , where is positive, also exhibit some easy to identify distinctive properties. We call these functions -th root functions .   Power functions: -th roots       Square-root function graph        Cube-root function graph          Fourth-root function graph        Fifth-root function graph        Again, we summarize some properties of these functions that the graphs make evident. In this case, since is always positive, it is only the parity (even\/odd) of that governs the general shape of the graph.   Properties of     Parity of Domain of Range of    Even    Odd      Modeling with power functions   Each graph in is the graph of a function of the form , is given. Find .   Modeling with power functions      Mystery graph of power function        Mystery graph of power function         Although not strictly necessary for solving this exercise, looking at , we see that the function graphed in (a) should be of the form , where is a positive odd numer, and the function graphed in (b) should be of the form , where is a positive even number.   Our function satisfies for all and . This implies that . Later, once we introduce logarithmic functions, we will have a systematic way of solving for . Instead, using our observation at the top that for some positive odd number , and doing some guess-and-check, we see that works. Thus .    Now our function satisfies and : , . Again, being guided by our observation at the top that for some positive even integer , and trying out the choices , we see that works. We conclude that .         Polynomials  In contrast to the simple power functions considered above, the behavior of polynomials can be quite complicated, and as a general rule becomes more and more complicated as the degree of the polynomial increases. This is illustrated in .   Polynomials of increasing degree.       Graph of cubic        Graph of quartic          Graph of quintic        We see that as the degree of the polynomials increases, the graphs of the functions tend to have more turning points (what we will later define as local maxima and local minimima ). Furthermore, it is not clear from these examples how the range of a polynomial is determined by its degree and\/or coefficients. Once again, calculus will provide us with the theoretical tools to answer questions related to these issues. For now, we will address another important question: how do we find the roots of a polynomial? Looking at the -intercepts of the graphs in , it appears that the number of roots of a polynomial has something to do with its degree. The following theorem gives a precise (if somewhat incomplete) articulation of this relationship.   Roots of polynomials   Let be a polynomial of positive degree .    has at most distinct roots.    A real number is a root of if and only if factors as for some polynomial .       Statement (1) of tells us that the degree of a polynomial bounds the number of possible real roots, and thus also the number of possible -intercepts. Thus, a quadratic polynomial has at most two roots, a cubic polynomial has at most three roots, a quartic polynomial has at most four roots, . Note that the theorem does not claim that a degree- polynomial must have roots. Indeed we have seen already examples of quadratic polynomials (degree-2) that have no (real) roots!   If we move from to the larger number system of complex numbers, then we can strengthen (1) of : namely, every polynomial of positive degree has  roots (counting multiplicity). This is the content of the fundamental theorem of algebra . The crucial detail here is the modifier complex in complex root .   Statement (2) of makes the connection between roots of polynomials and factorization. As a result, the more we are able to factor a polynomial, the more we can say about its roots; conversely, every time we find a root of polynomial , we can make progress on the factorization of by factoring out that root. Factoring polynomials is thus an important skill, and we gather here some techniques for doing this.   Polynomial long division     Let and be polynomials of positive degree. There are unique polynomials and satisfying . We call and the quotient and remainder upon division of by .  The process of computing and is called polynomial longdivision of by . We illustrate this process in . See also     A real number is a root of the polynomial if and only if the remainder upon dividing by is the zero polynomial. In this case we have and .        Polynomial long division   Find the quotient and remainder upon dividing by .    You may remember that long division of by proceeds iteratively, where at each step we multiply by a monomial in order to match the leading term of the polynomial being divided. We spell this out in more detail in the steps below, but you are probably more accustomed to steps in this process being shown as in , and indeed that is the way you should perform this operation. Consider the following as just an in-depth description of what we are actually doing in that process.   Multiply by a monomial so that the leading terms of and match. In this case we choose the monomial .  Set our temporary quotient  as and our temporary remainder  as .    If is not less than for our temporary remainder , repeat Step 1 with and (instead of and ). Update our temporary quotient by adding to it the relevant monomial , and update our temporary remainder by subtracting from it.  In the present case, since , we multiply by the monomial in order to match the leading term of , and update our and as follows:     Continue this updating process until .  In our case, we need to do one more iteration. To match the leading terms, we multiply by the monomial . Updating our and yields . Since , we are done. We conclude that , where .        Polynomial long division                                Polynomial root check   Let . For each , decide whether is a root by computing , then verify your answer using .                   Since , we see that is not a root of . According to this means that dividing by should result in a nonzero remainder polynomial . We verify by performing longdivision:              +3             2    Thus diving by yields a quotient of and remainder of : , . Since is not the zero polynomial we conclude (again) that is not a root.    Similarly, we compute , showing that is a root of . Now perform longdivision of by :              +3             0    Since is the zero polynomial, we conclude (again) that is a root, and furthermore the quotient yields the factorization .       You may have noticed that the two candidate roots of the polynomial in were integer factors of its constant term. As it turns out, given a polynomial with integer coefficients , any integer root of that polynomial must be a factor of its constant term.   Integer root theorem   Let and assume that all the coefficients of are integers: , for all . Any integer root of must be a factor of : , if and , then is a factor of .    Note the crucial detail in : an integer root of a polynomial with integer coefficients must divide the constant term. The theorem says nothing about possible non-integer roots, as the next example illustrates.   Integer roots   Let .   Find all integer roots of .    Find all roots of .          Since has integer coefficents, if is an integer root of , then it must be a factor of its constant term , according to . Thus the only possible integer roots of are . But and . Thus none of these candidates is a root, showing has no integer roots.    Since is a quadratic function, it is easy to determine its roots. As usual, there are multiple ways of doing this, but in this case the easiest method would be to proceed as follows: . Thus, although has no integer roots, its has the two real roots .       Once we find a root of a polynomial , the resulting factorization allows us to find all further roots by continuiung the process on , as the next example illustrates.   Polynomial roots   Find all roots of .    From , we know that factors as , and thus that is a root of . Are there any other roots? Suppose . Evaluating at yields . Since , . By , we have if and only if . Thus, is a root of if and only if it is a root of . But using , we see that the quadratic function has not roots! We conclude that is the only root of .    Let's make official the method and reasoning in this last example.   Factoring polynomials and finding roots   To find all roots of a polynomial , you may proceed as follows.   Factor as best you can as a product of polynomials of smaller degree: .    A real number is a root of if and only if it is a root of one of the polynomials . Thus by finding all roots of each polynomial , we find all roots of .       Note that the success depends on our ability to find all the roots of the factor polynomials . Accordingly, the smaller the degree of the , the more likely we are in being able to find all roots of . In particular, we will be home free if we are able to factor far enough so that all factor polynomials are of degree one or two.   Roots of a quartic   Find all roots of .    Since the coefficients of are integers, we first try and find an integer root of using . Evaluating for (the factors of the constant term of ), we see that , and thus that is a factor of . Using polynomial longdivision (we skip the steps here), we see that . Now continue the process by factoring . Again using , we try as potential roots. It turns out that , and thus can be factored out (again). Using polynomial longdivision (again we omit the steps), we find that , and thus that . Lastly, we apply to the remaining factor , concluding that it has no roots. By , we conclude that the only root of is .     Multiplicity of a root  The factorization from tells us that is a repeated root of of multiplicity two. In general, if a polynomial factors as , where is not a root of ( , ), then is called a root of multiplicity . For example, the polynomial has a double root ( , root of multipicity two) at , a simple root ( , root of multiplicity one) at , and a quadruple root at . From the factorization, we know further that has no additional roots, since has not roots.  As we will see later in the course, the multiplicity of a root provides further nuanced information about how a polynomial behaves near a the root.   Although we have been focusing on factoring polynomials by finding roots, this is not always the easiest way to proceed. Indeed, there are polynomials that can be factored nontrivially and yet have no roots. For example, the polynomial factors as . provides a couple of tricks for factoring polynomials that sometimes come in handy when we cannot easily find roots. The factorization above can be thought of an instance of (2) of . We have , where . Since factors as , we see that factors as .   Factoring tools      Difference of powers  For all , and all integers , we have . In particular, we have .    Polynomial expression of  If we can write a polynnomial as for some polynomial , then a factorization of gives rise to the factorization .       Factoring polynomials turns out to be our main tool for solving general polynomial equations, as we detail in .   Solving polynomial equations   Consider a polynomial equation of the form . To solve this equation for , proceed as follows.   Use algebra to bring all terms to the left side (using addition\/subtraction), obtaining an equation of the form .    Factor the polynomial on the left side of as much as possible to obtain an equation of the form .    The solutions of the original equation are precisely the roots of the polynomials .        Solving a polynomial equation   Find all solutions to the equation . Follow .    First bring the equation in to the form : . Luckily, helps us find an easy integer root of the polynomial on the left, allowing us to factor (in two steps) as . From the factored equation we conclude that the solutions to the original equation are (a repeated root here) and .    Another important consequence of that we will make use of later in the course has to do with when two polynomials are equal (as functions), as articulated in . In order to make sense of that result, we need to first make clear what we mean by two functions being equal. Recall our original intuitive idea of a function as a rule (or assignment ) that assigns to each element of a specified input set (the domain) a unique output. When should we consider two such things to be the same? For one thing, they should have the same specified set of inputs ( , the same domain): this is condition (1) of . Moreover, in order to represent the same rule (or assignment), each input should be assigned to the same output: this is condition (2) of .   Function equality   Functions and are equal , denoted if the following conditions hold:    and have the same domain .     for all .        Function equality  Note well the all important for all quantifier appearing in condition (2) of . That detail makes the notion of function equality more nuanced than a simple numeric equality (like ). Given two functions and with common domain , the statement is in fact a claim that a whole bunch of numeric equalities hold: namely, we have for every . That's one equality for each . Since is most often an infinite set (like an interval) for us, this means that typically asserts that infinitely many numeric equalities hold. In this sense a function equality is very similar to the notion of an identity (like ), which you may have encountered before.   Having made clear what we mean in general by function equality, we now look at the specific case of polynomial functions. can be shown to be a consequence of , though we will omit that argument.   Polynomial equality   Let be polynomials defined on a common infinite domain , and assume and are both nonzero. We have if and only if the following conditions hold:    ( , );     for all .   In other words, two polynomials are equal as functions if and only if they have the same degree and coefficients.      Rational functions  Equipped now with some machinery for factoring polynomials, we can take a closer look at rational functions, which you will recall are just quotients of polynomials. In this section we will be interested only in determining the implied domain and zeros of a rational function. Before treating this specific family of functions, we first make official a simple observation about the domain and zeros of any function defined as a quotient of two functions.   Quotients of functions   Assume is a function of the form , where and are functions.   The implied domain of is the set of for which (a) and are both defined, and (b) .    The set of zeros of is the set of zeros of that lie in : , . Equivalently, using logical shorthand: .       In the special case where is a quotient of two polynomials , the statements of are simplified by the fact that and are defined everywhere, and have finitely many zeros.   Domain and zeros of rational functions   Let , where and are polynomials.   The implied domain of is .    The set of zeros of is the set of zeros of that are not zeros of : , . Equivalently, using logical shorthand: .       Since the domain and zeros of a rational function are determined by the zeros of and , and since by nonzero polynomials have only finitely many zeros (bounded in number by the polynomial's degree), it follows that is defined everywhere except for the finitely many zeros of , and has finitely many zeros.   Rational functions: domain and zeros   Compute the implied domain and set of zeros for the given rational function.                   We have , where . Since the zeros of are and , the implied domain of is . The set of zeros of is the set of where and . Since is zero only at , and since is a zero of , we conclude that has no zeros: , .    We have , where . Since the zeros of are and , the implied domain of is , as above. The set of zeros of is the set of where and . Since is zero at and , and since is a zero of , we conclude that 1 is the only zero of .       In you find graphs of the functions and from . Consistent with our work in that example, the graphs indicate that has no zeros and has exactly one zero, at .

Interestingly, the two graphs indicate that and are excluded from the domain in slightly different ways.   The graph of has what we will eventually call a vertical asymptote at , and a hole at .    The graph of has a hole at and a vertical asymptote at .   The vertical asymptote behavior of the two graphs is something we will discuss in great detail later. For now we content ourselves to an explanation of the holes appearing in these graphs. Let's look only at . Our analyis is somewhat involved, so we will break it up into a few steps.   Technically, is not in the domain of , and thus there should be no plotted point on the graph of over .    However, for any , we may cancel the nonzero terms in our expression above to get the simpler expression . That is, we have .    Let . Technically and are not equal as functions, as is reflected in the fact that has domain and has domain . However, for all , we have .    Since , the point appears on the graph of . Furthermore, if we graph , we see that points on its graph approach as gets closer and closer to . (As we will see later, this is a result of being continuous at .)    Lastly, since the graph of agrees with the graph of for all , points on its graph also approach as gets closer and closer to . As a result, the graph of appears to approach the point , but without this point being included on the graph itself. Hence the hole!   Well, that was a bit long winded! One amazing feature of calculus is its ability to express such cumbersome arguments in a much more economical manner. For example, using the language of limits (to be introduced soon), our discussion above can be beautifully compressed into the following simple statement: .   "

Understand how the definitions of even and odd functions correspond to certain types of symmetry in the graph of a function.    Determine algebraically whether a function is even, odd, or neither.    Application: the vertex form of a quadratic function arises from a series of transformations of the function .       Transformations  Having become more or less acquainted with a few families of functions (linear functions, power functions, polynomials, rational functions, ), we now try to extend our knowledge to various arithmetic combinations of these basic types.  In this section we will focus on a particularly simple case of such combinations. Namely, we will consider the following types of function operations, called function transformations : , where is a constant. In each case above, the function above is the result of a shifting or scaling by the constant ; and furthermore, this shifting\/scaling is applied either to the output  (the outside of the function), or to the input  (the inside of the function). What exactly is the result of this shifting and scaling, and what difference does it make to do so on the inside versus the outside of the function?   Desmos: function transformations   The Desmos interactive in allows you to explore the graphical relationship between an original function and four different type of transformations of : . Articulate what effect these operations have on the graph of .   Desmos interactive : graphical effect of function transformations      Hopefully, the Desmos interactive strongly suggests a graphical interpretation of each of the four different types of transformations. Our next two examples take on the two additive transformations: .   Vertical shift   The key to understanding the graphical effect of the transformation is the observation that a point lies on the graph of if and only if the point lies on the graph of . This is because . As a result, the graph of is obtained from the graph of by shifting it a directed distance of units. The modifier directed is used here to take notice of the sign of . More directly, assuming , we have the following graphical interpretation:   the graph of is obtained from the graph of by shifting up  units;    the graph of is obtained from the graph of by shifting down  units.      shifts up two units. shifts down two units.       Horizontal shift   Similarly, to understand the graphical effect of the transformation we observe that a point lies on the graph of if and only if the point lies on the graph of . This is because . As a result, we obtain the graph of by shifting the graph of by the directed distance . More directly, assuming , we conclude:   the graph of is obtained from the graph of by shifting units to the left ;    the graph of is obtained from the graph of by shifting units to the right .      shifts left five units. shifts right five units.      Our next two examples take a closer look at our multiplicative transformations  . For these transformations, both the sign and size of the constant have a significant effect on the resulting graphical transformation. Our next examples consider the case where .   Vertical scaling   Assume and consider the transformation . A point lies on the graph of if and only the point lies on the graph of . This is because . As a result, the graph of is obtained by taking points on the graph of and scaling their -coordinates by the constant . This has the graphical effect of vertically stretching (if ) or vertically shrinking (if ) the graph of .   stretches vertically by 2. shrinks vertically by 2.       Horizontal scaling   Assume and now consider the transformation . A point lies on the graph of if and only the point lies on the graph of . This is because . As a result, the graph of is obtained by taking points on the graph of and scaling their -coordinates by the constant . This has the graphical effect of horizontally stretching (if ) or vertically shrinking (if ) the graph of .   compresses horizontally by 2. stretches horizontally by 2.   Horizontal scaling of graphs        Transformations: vertical versus horizontal effects  A clear pattern emerges from the four types of transformations we have considered. Transformations that affect the output  (the outside of the function) have a vertical effect on the graph of the function, while transformations that affect the input  (the inside of the function) have a horizontal effect on the graph of the function. Furthermore, for both types of transformations, additive changes ( ) result in shifts, while multiplicative changes ( ) result in stretches or shrinks.  Note also that the transformations involving the input give rise to a graphical effect that is the reverse of what you might have initially expected. For example, the transformation shifts the graph of to the left by 3 units, not to the right . Similarly, the transformation shrinks the graph of horizontally by a factor of 2, rather than stretching it.   It remains only to consider our scaling transformations for a negative constant . We can answer that question just by looking at what happens when we multiply by .   Vertical and horizontal reflection   Following the same chain of logic as in the examples above we observe that a point lies on the graph of if and only if the point lies on the graph of . Graphically, this means that the graph of is obtained by reflecting the graph of across the -axis.  Similarly, a point lies on the graph of if and only if the point lies on the graph of . Graphically, this means that the graph of is obtained by reflecting the graph of across the -axis.   reflects across the -axis (red). reflects across the -axis (green).      So how do we understand a transformation like ? The key is to think of this as a sequence of two transformations: . The first transformation reflects the graph of across the -axis; the second shrinks the resulting graph by a factor of two. Combined, we see that the transformation reflects the graph of across the -axis and then shrinks it horizontally by a factor of two.  Let's make official the results of our analysis of the four types of function transformations.   Function transformations   The graphical effect of the various types of functions transformations is summarized in    Function transformations    Transformation  Graphical Result  Algebraic Result          shifts left units if      shifts right units if           shifts up units if      shifts down units if           horizontal shrink by if      horizontal stretch by if           vertical stretch by if      vertical shrink by if           graph reflects across the -axis           graph reflects across the -axis              Transformations   Consider the function given in below. Describe in words how the function is the result of three transformations of . Does the order in which these transformations occur matter? Why or why not?   The function .      There are three basic transformations involved: a vertical shift of 1 unit down, a horizontal shift of 1 unit left, and a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. To understand the order in which these transformations are applied, it's essential to remember that a function is a process that converts inputs to outputs.  By the algebraic rule for , . In words, this means that given an input for , we do the following processes in this particular order:   add 1 to and then apply the function to the quantity ;    multiply the output of by 2;    subtract 1 from the output of .     These three steps correspond to three basic transformations:   shift the graph of to the left by 1 unit;    stretch the resulting graph vertically by a factor of 2;    shift the resulting graph vertically by units.     We can see the graphical impact of these algebraic steps by taking them one at a time. Note that in each of the following figures, we track the point from the original function.   In , we see the function that results from a shift of 1 unit left of the function in . The tracked point first moves left 1 unit to . (Each time we take an additional step, we will de-emphasize the preceding function by having it appear in lighter color and dashed.)   The function .      Continuing, we now consider the function , which results in a vertical stretch away from the -axis by a factor of 2, as seen in . The tracked point is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 away from the -axis to .   The function .      Finally, we arrive at by subtracting 1 from the previous graph; this of course is a vertical shift of units, and produces the graph of shown in red in . The tracked point is shifted 1 unit down to the point .   The function .       While there are some transformations that can be executed in either order (such as the combination of a horizontal translation and a vertical translation, in other situations order matters. In this example, we have to apply the vertical stretch before applying the vertical shift, Algebraically, this is because . The quantity multiplies the function by 2 first (the stretch) and then the vertical shift follows; the quantity shifts the function down 1 unit first, and then executes a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. In the latter scenario, the point that lies on gets transformed first to and then to , which is not the same as the point that lies on .     Vertical and horizontal translations, stretches, and reflections   The figure that follows shows a piece of the graph of a parabola with five marked points. Sketch graphs for each of the given transformations. On each graph, mark the new coordinates of the five marked points      , and      , and      and         Symmetry  Some graphs do not change under certain transformations. For example, the graph of shown in below remains the same if we reflect it across the -axis. We say that this function has -axis reflectional symmetry .   is preserved under reflection across the -axis.    As another example, the graph of shown in below remains the same if we reflect it first across the -axis and then across the -axis. This double-reflection across the - and -axis is equivalent to rotation around the origin by . Take a moment to experiment with this: on a piece of scrap paper, draw a smiley face or some other picture. Flip the paper vertically and then horizontally (or horizontally and then vertically). This gives you the same result as rotating the paper by 180 degrees. A function that is preserved under the transformation of rotation is said to have  rotational symmetry .   is preserved under rotation about the origin.    These types of symmetries are also called even symmetry and odd symmetry , since power functions with even powers all have -axis symmetry and power functions with odd powers all have rotational symmetry. Let's try to understand algebraically what makes the graph of a function have even or odd symmetry. The graph has even symmetry when the following equivalence holds: . Since a point is on the graph of if and only if is in the domain of and , we see that the above equivalence is equivalent to the algebraic statement for all in the domain of . Similarly, the graph of has odd symmetry if and only if for all in its domain. This is the motivation for the following definition and table.   Even and odd functions   Let be a function whose domain satisfies the following property: if , then .    is even if for all .     is odd if for all .        Even and odd symmetry    Symmetry name  Alg. definition  Graphical symmetry    Even -axis reflectional symmetry    Odd rotational symmetry      Even\/odd: domain  Observe the technical restriction placed on the domain of a function in . Namely, we do not even ask whether a function is even or odd, if its domain does not satisfy the property . For example, -th root functions for even are not possible candidates for evenness or oddness, since their domain does not satisfy this property: , , but .    Even\/odd power functions   Let , where is a nonzero integer. Show that is even if is even, and odd if is odd.    First consider the case where is even. For any in the domain of , we have . Thus is even in this case, as claimed.  Now assume is odd. Now we have for all , showing to be odd.    It should be noted that being even or odd is a special property not enjoyed by all functions. In fact, chances are, if you write down a random algebraic function, it will be neither even nor odd.  The argument used to show that a function is not even (or not odd), is qualitatively very different than for showing the function is even (or is odd). Namely, to show the property in question does not hold, it suffices to find a single explicit counterexample. The next example illustrates this.    Show that the function is neither even nor odd.    First observe that the implied domain of is , since is a polynomial. To show is not even, it suffices to show that for some element . This is easy: we have , and thus . We conclude that is not even.  Similarly, to show is not odd, we need only find an iput satisfying . The same input works in this case as well, since .      Sketch a graph that has neither -axis symmetry nor rotational symmetry. Congratulations! You have drawn the graph of a function that is neither even nor odd.     illustrates the important role played by the for all quantifier in . A function is even (or odd) if it satisfies the relevant equation for all elements in its domain; and it is not even (or not odd) if it fails to satisfy the relevant equation for some element in its domain. In essence, being even or odd is a function equality statement involving the two functions and : is even if (as functions); and is odd if (as functions). (See .)  Consider the example again. In deciding whether is even or odd, we really are comparing it with the function . Comparing the formulas for and , it seems clear that these two functions are not equal, and hence that is not even. But we need to be careful here! As we have seen before, different formulas can sometimes be seen to define the same function after some algebra. The surefire way of showing two functions are not equal is find a single instance of an input where their outputs differ. This is exactly what we did in the solution to .  In this particular case, however, we are aided by the fact that all the functions involved are polynomials , and that polynomial equality is equivalent to having like coefficients. (See .) That is, we can immediately see that the three functions are distinct simply by comparing their coefficients. It follows that is not even (since ) and is not odd (since ).  Of course, not all functions are polynomials, and so things are not always this straightforward. When in doubt, to definitely show a function is not even (or not odd), provide an explicit counterexample.   Even\/odd\/neither   Determine algebraically whether the given function is even, odd, or neither. Confirm your answer graphically using .                    Graphs of example functions                Sageplot of function h         We first determine algebraically whether each function satisfies the definition of even or odd (or if it does not) and then verify graphically.   First observe that the domain of is . Since for all , we see that is odd. Looking at the formulas, it seems clear that for all , and hence that is not even. To be sure, however, we provide a counterexample: we have and . Since , we conclude that is not even.    In this case the implied domain of is . Since for all , we conclude that is even.  Is odd? In this case since and are both polynomials, we see that the two functions are not equal simply by comparing coefficients. Thus is not odd.    The implied domain of is , since for all . We have for all . Looking just at the formulas, it seems that the function is equal neither to nor . To be sure, however, we provide explicit counterexamples to both evenness and oddness.  Note that and . Since , we conclude that is not even. Furthermore, since , we conclude that is not odd.   Looking at the graphs of , , and , in , we can confirm our conclusions above immediately: the graph of exhibits rotational symmetry, but not -axis reflectional symmetry; the graph of exhibits -axis reflectional symmetry, but not rotational symmetry; and the graph of exhibits neither type of symmetry.      Vertex form of a quadratic function  Recall that every quadratic function can be expressed in vertex form as for some constants and . This result, along with our newfound understanding of function transformations, allows us to relate the graph of to the graph of the simple power function . Indeed, applying the sequence of transformations yields the sequence of functions . As a result, the graph of an arbitrary quadratic function can be obtained from the graph of by performing a horizontal shift, followed by a vertical scaling, followed by a vertical shift. illustrates this process for the function .

Transformations that affect the output  (the outside of the function) have a vertical effect on the graph of the function, while transformations that affect the input  (the inside of the function) have a horizontal effect on the graph of the function. Furthermore, for both types of transformations, additive changes ( ) result in shifts, while multiplicative changes ( ) result in stretches or shrinks.  Note also that the transformations involving the input give rise to a graphical effect that is the reverse of what you might have initially expected. For example, the transformation shifts the graph of to the left by 3 units, not to the right .

  "body": " Function composition    Functions Composition of Functions     Learning Goals     Understand what it means to compose two functions    Calculate values of compositions of functions given tables, graphs, or formulas    Simplify the formula for a composition of functions    Determine the domain of a composition of functions    See an example where composition of functions is vital to studying calculus       Motivation and Examples  Recall that a function, by definition, is a process that takes a collection of inputs and produces a corresponding collection of outputs in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value. Because every function is a process, it makes sense to think that it may be possible to take two function processes and do one of the processes first, and then apply the second process to the result.  Recall Dolbear's function, , from Example that relates the number of chirps per minute from a snowy cricket to the Fahrenheit temperature, .  The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are connected by a linear function. Indeed, the function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius is   For instance, a Fahrenheit temperature of 32 degrees corresponds to degrees Celsius.  If we are given a number of chirps, , we can combine the two processes given by Dolbear's function and the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius to obtain a new function that takes as input the number of chirps per minute and gives as output the temperature in degrees Celsius.    Using Dolbear's model, what is the temperature in degrees Celsius assuming we observe crickets chirping at 80 chirps per minute?    First, we compute that the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is .  It remains only to convert this Fahrenheit temperature to degrees Celsius: . Thus, if crickets chirp at 80 chirps per minute, Dolbear's model predicts the temperature is .      Determine a formula for the new function that takes as input the number of cricket chirps per minute and gives as output the temperature in degrees Celsius.    Using as the input for the function , we simplify to find a formula directly from to that does not involve the variable :   So the function is given by .       Function composition The function explored in the examples above is called the composition of and , denoted . Let's make this definition official.   Function composition   Given a function , and a function with domain satisfying , their composition  is the function defined as for all .     The composition uses the outputs of as the inputs of .     Function composition  Observe the important condition in the setup of a composition of two functions and : we need the range of to be a subset of the domain of . Let's think through why this must be the case.  By definition the composition function takes an input and maps it to the output . In order for this to make sense, we need to be in the domain of . In other words, the outputs of must lie in the domain of : this is equivalent to saying that the range of is a subset of the domain of .    Composition is not multiplication  The notation for function composition is similar looking to the notation for function multiplication. Do not conflate these two operations! Indeed, comparing and at an arbitrary input, we see that , which are by no means the same thing.    Composition: evaluation and formulas   Let and . Define .   Compute .    Find a formula for .          By definition, we have .    The formula for is computed in much the same way as above, replacing with the variable : .    The implied domain of is the set of for which is defined at and is defined at . The function is defined at as long as is nonzero; but this is true for all , since for all . Similarly, the expression is defined as long as is nonzero. As already observed, this is true for all . Thus the implied domain of is .        Composition: order matters   Define as and .   Compute formulas for and .    Do we have ?          We compute .    From the above we see that and are both quadratic polynomials. Recall that two polynomials of the same degree are equal as functions if and only if their coefficients are all equal. (See .) Comparing coefficients above, we see easily that .  Moral of the story: the order of composition matters! That is, the function is not necessarily the same as .        Inner\/outer function  The function in a composition is often called the inner function of the composition, and is called the outer function . This terminology derives naturally from the definition . Alternatively, we can use sequential language when describing the roles of and in the composition . That is, when computing using definition , we first evaluate at to produce the output , and then evaluate at to produce the output .  This sequential way of looking at composition is especially helpful when trying to describe a given function as a composition of two functions.    Expressing functions as compositions   Express the given function as a composition . Give explicit formulas for your choice of and .                   The particular form of the of the formula here strongly suggests the the outer function  should be , and the inner function  should be . Let confirm that : for all , we have for all . This proves .    In this example the inner function and outer function is less obvious. Let's use the sequential description of function composition to help us out. Looking at the formula for , we see that to evaluate at a given , we must first compute , and then compute the reciprocal of this expression . Thus suggests that we should set and . Let's check that our choice of and work: we have for all in the implied domain of . Thus .       The next two examples illustrate how to compute values of a composition of functions when the function information is provided by tables or graphs.   Composition: using tables   Suppose that and are given by the table      Compute the given expression or else explain why the tables do not provide enough information.

On the other hand, we do not have enough information from the table to compute since and the table does not indicate what is.    First observe that for . Thus for for , we need to find the in this set such that or . From the table we see that and . Thus are the two solutions to the equation lying in the set .    Our reasoning is similar to the previous part. Since for and since the solutions to for are and , these are the solutions to lying in .        Composition: using graphs   The graphs of functions and are given below.   Compute the following function values.    .                    We have .    We have .    We have .         Implied domain of compositions  How do we determine the implied domain of a composition of two functions? For to be defined at , we need two conditions to hold:    is defined at ;     is defined at .   Thus the implied domain of is the set of for which both and are defined. Using set intersection notation (see ), we have . Let's compute some simple examples. After we develop techniques for solving inequalities, we will consider more complicated examples.   Composition: implied domain   Let and . Find the implied domain of .    The implied domain of is the set of where is defined and where is defined.  For to be defined, we need , or equivalently .  For to be defined, we need further that , or equivalently, .  Thus both conditions are satisfied if and only if and . In other words, the implied domain of is .

Composition: implied domain  When computing the formula for a composition , there is always the danger of overlooking what the implied domain is. Consider the example where we take . Our usual implied domain analysis yields that the implied domain of is the set of all . However, if computing a formula for , we see that , suggesting that the implied domain of should be . How do we reconcile these two different conclusions? Here's how: the steps in the algebra above used to compute the formula for are only valid for inputs where and are defined in the first place! In other words, our identity is itself only true for , and this is consistent with our determination of the implied domain.     "

We will need to solve inequalities in order to explore functions in general and answer many interesting questions, and so we summarize the relevant rules and develop the necessary techniques for solving inequalities. Let's begin by defining what we mean by an \"inequality.\"  An inequality consists of two mathematical expressions related by a greater-than , less-than , greater-than-or-equal-to , or less-than-or-equal-to sign. The solution set of an inequality is the set of all values that make the inequality true. Wheres the solution set of an equation often consists of a finite number of points, the solution set of an inequality is often an interval of real numbers, or unions of intervals.  For example, whereas the solution to is the single number , the solution to is the set , which we recognize as the interval .  The inequality in the last example was solved in much the same way the corresponding equality is solved: . That is we isolated the term by adding to both sides of the inequality. The reason why this step is valid is that if , then for any : , adding a constant to two numbers preserves the inequality relation between them.  What about multiplying both sides of an equality by a nonzero constant? Is it true that if , then for any nonzero ? No! Consider the following example: , but . We have (re)discovered the first nuance about solving inequalities: multiplying numbers by nonzero constants doesn't necessarily preserve their inequality relation: in fact, if the constant is negative, the relation is reversed! Below we make official this observation, along with some other elementary inequality rules.   Elementary inequality rules      Add constant  For any constant and any , we have .    Multiply by constant  Assume is a positive constant and is a negative one. For all we have .    Reciprocal  For all , we have .         Elementary inequality rules  The statements in remain true if we place with . Why? The relation means less than or equal to . Since the statements above are true with respect to the relation (the content of the theorem) and to the relation , it follows logically that they are true with respect to the relation .    Visualizing inequalities  The English phrases less than and greater than unfortunately obscure somewhat the meaning of the relations and . For example, we are tempted to translate the statement as is smaller than . But this is not what the means. Indeed, we have , and yet is not smaller than . The correct way of understanding is as a statement about the relative position of and on the number line. That is, we have .   Equipped with the inequality rules of , we are able to solve elementary inequalities in much the same way we do equalities, but taking due care when multiplying by negative constants or taking reciprocals.   Solving elementary inequalities   Solve the given inequality. Express your answer using interval notation or set builder notation.                   We solve . Thus the set of solutions is the interval .    Clearly, we want to use the reciprocal rule here, but we need to be careful since to do so, the signs of both sides of the inequality have to agree! We handle this by separately treating the cases where is negative and positive.  Note that if and only if if and only if . In this case we certainly have . Thus the interval is part of our solution.  Now assume . In this case is positive, allowing us to use the reciprocal rule. We solve: . Thus is the set of all satisfying the inequality with .  Combining our two cases, we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is .        Checking the answer graphically  You can check our solution to by graphing (in red) and (in green), as shown in . The values of for which the line described by has -coordinate greater than are those to the left of .   is above for .      Paying attention to sign  Our solution to the second inequality of illustrates how careful consideration of the signs (positive\/negative) involved in an inequality can make the solution even to an elementary looking inequality somewhat involved. The sign diagram technique developed later in this section will make these issues much easier to deal with.     Sign diagram technique   allows us to solve a linear inequality almost exactly as we would the corresponding linear equality ; we just need to be careful about the sign when multiplying both sides by . With anything more complicated, however, solving inequalities becomes much more subtle.  Consider the quadratic inequality . Since adding any constant to both sides preserves the inequality, we can add to both sides to conclude . We might be tempted to multiply both sides of the equation by (we can exclude , since the inequality clearly doesn't hold for this choice), however we need to remember that depending on whether is negative or positive, the inequality might flip. This leads to two separate cases.  A slightly more streamlined approach would be to use factoring: . Now use the fact that a product of two numbers is negative if and only if the two numbers have different signs: . Note that the left side of our or statement was eventually discarded since there is no number satisfying and . In all we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is the interval .  We should make official at this point our observation about the sign of a product of numbers.   Sign of a product   Let and be nonzero real numbers. We have if and only if and have the same sign, and if and only if and have opposite signs. In other words: .    A similar approach can be used for a more general quadratic inequality : namely, first make the right side of the inequality 0 ( ); then try to factor the left side ( ); then treat the different cases coming from . However, we are interested in one technique that works not only for quadratic inequalities, but also inequalities involving any algebraic function. This leads us to what we call a sign diagram technique.  Consider again the inequality . We can interpret this as a statement about the function : namely, the set of solutions to the inequality is precisely the set of where is negative. This set is easily visualized by a graph of .      The graph confirms that if and only if , just as we had deduced above. It also brings to light another property that will be useful for solving inequalities: the sign of the function does not change until we reach a zero. In the example above, we have on the entire interval , on , and on . This is elegantly summarized by the sign diagram of below.   Sign diagram of .      As it turns out, this constancy of sign exhibited by is enjoyed not just by all quadratic functions, but indeed by all algebraic functions. The property seems intuitively true: a function shouldn't be able to switch from positive to negative, or vice versa, without crossing the -axis. However, to prove this property rigorously, we need some help from calculus: namely, the notion of a continuous function, as well as the intermediate value property that continuous functions enjoy. We will get to these in due time, at which point we will re-visit the discussion here. For now, we will take on faith this property of sign, that we articulate in the theorem below.   Constancy of sign: algebraic functions   Let be an algebraic function. If is an interval containing no zeros of and no points where is undefined, then is either always positive or always negative on .     is the theoretical underpinning of the following procedure for solving inequalities. Although the procedure is stated for inequalities of the form ,   Sign diagram   To solve an inequality involving algebraic functions, proceed as follows.   Standard form  Use to express the inequality in one of the forms , where is an algebraic function.    Number line diagram  Produce a number line diagram that includes points for all zeros of , as well as any individual points where is not defined.    Sign diagram  Identify the sign of on the resulting open intervals that have the points in Step 2 as endpoints. This can be done by evaluating at a test point in each of these intervals, or by using elementary inequality properties.    Solve the standard form inequality derived in Step 1 by identifying the relevant intervals in your sign diagram.        Sign diagram: rational function   Use to provide another solution to the inequality .    We first bring the inequality into a standard form: . The rational function is undefined at and has a zero at . Thus we begin with the number line diagram   Sign diagram of rational function    Next we identify the sign of on the three intervals , , .

In this section we discuss functions that are NOT algebraic functions. Instead, they are pieced together by parts of algebraic functions.  A piecewise-defined function is is a function that is defined in multiple pieces, with different formulas or rules for different parts of its domain. The sign function defined below is a natural first example in light of our recent work with sign diagrams.   Sign function    the sign function    The sign function , , is the function defined as In other words, is 1 if is positive, -1 if is negative, and 0 otherwise.    The notation in is our way of presenting the different rules that apply to the different subsets of the domain. In general if the domain of our piecewise-defined functionis broken up into subsets , then the notation is understood as defining to be the function that follows the rule (or formula) on the ``domain piece\" , on the ``domain piece\" , . In the case of the sign function, the three different rules are particular simple: namely, the function outputs 1, 0, or -1 depending on whether the input is positive, zero, or negative.  Once you get used to the notation, you will see that working with piecewise-defined functions is done much the same as usual. However, because the a piecewise function is defined in cases , our computations involving these functions naturally break up into cases (or parts).  For example, when graphing the function, we effectively make three separate graphs over the separate pieces of the domain: we graph the constant function on , we graph the function on , and we add the single point to complete the graph.   Graph of .        Let be the function defined piecewise as . To graph we graph the function on the domain and the function on the domain . Note that we must be careful about the value of at the cutoff input . Since this value is included in the first case of the definition, we have , corresponding to the point on the graph below.   Graph of        An Application of Piecewise-defined Functions  Piecewise-defined functions are useful for many real-word problems where the relationship between the quantities involved are different on different time-frames. For example, a person's salary changes when they get a raise, which changes the amount that they earn each year.    Suppose that in your first job after graduating from college you make $36,000 a year before taxes. After four years you get a raise of $2,500. Two years after that you change jobs and go to work for a company that pays you $49,000 a year.  We can construct a piecewise-defined function that describes your pretax income in the year that is years after you graduate from college as follows. Note that this is just the function that describes your income rate per year at a time (the units are dollars per year).   What may be more interesting is to describe that amount that you will have earned  years after graduating from college. During the first four years, you make $36,000 per year, and so the amount that you earn after years is . After four years, you have already earned $ . Then for the next two years, you earn $38,500 per year, so your additional income for is given by (because we have to measure in years since  ). Thus overall for , you have earned by time . Lastly, after 6 years you have earned $ , and for each additional year you earn $49,000, so by time you have earned when .  Summarizing this, the function for total earnings at time years since graduation is   If you continue at that pay rate, how long will it have taken you to earn a million dollars? Well, we know we did not make that much by , so we use the equation for and solve for :   So in your 22nd year after graduating you will have earned one million pretax dollars.      How much will you have earned five years after graduating, according to the model described in Example ? What is your salary in that year?      For another example, suppose a doctor charges a different amount of money based on the length of the appointment. Example from https:\/\/www.mathsisfun.com\/sets\/functions-piecewise.html , accessed Sept 15, 2022.    Up to 6 minutes costs $50    Over 6 and up to 15 minutes costs $80    Over 15 minutes costs $80 plus $5 per minute above 15 minutes     We can write the price of an office visit like this:       Absolute value and distance  For the rest of the section we will focus on one specific example of a piecewise-defined function that plays an essential role in calculus: the absolute value function  . What makes this function so valuable to us, is that it introduces a quantitative notion of distance to points on the real number line. Indeed, our first definition of the absolute value will be expressed entirely in these geometric terms.   Absolute value (geometric)   Given a real number we define its absolute value to be the its distance from 0 on the number line. In more detail, is the length of the line segment between and .    The diagram in illustrates how we compute using our geometric definition in terms of distance. From the indicated distances there, we see that . Furthermore, since the distance between the point and itself is , we see that .   Understanding in terms of distance   Number line diagram for absolute value     Exploring our geometric definition further, we see that for any positive number , we have . This is because both points and are a distance of from the point .   Absolute value of a positive number and its minus    Put another way, given any real number , to specify its location on the number line, we need two pieces of information:   whether lies to the left or right of ;    the distance from to .   The first piece of information is given by the sign of : that is, lies to the left of if and only if , and to the right if and only if . The second piece of information is given by the absolute value . In this light, you can think of the absolute value function as ignoring the sign of a number and just returning its distance to zero. This is another explanation of why .   Large and small, greater than and less than  The foregoing discussion brings to light some linguistic subtleties surrounding mathematical notions like the relation, the relation, and the absolute value .  Namely, although the two relations and are translated into English as less than and greater than , a statement like is not an indication of the relative size (or magnitude ) of and , but rather their relative position on the real number line! In this sense, the correct geometric way to think of the statement is as follows: . By contrast, the size of a number is measured by its absolute value . Moreover, to say one number is smaller or larger than another is to say its absolute value is less than or greater than the other number's absolute value: , we have . As a result, the sign of a number has nothing to do with its size! To illustrate this, note that the three sequences of numbers below are all examples where the terms are getting arbitrarily large: . In more detail we say that the first is a sequence of positive numbers that get arbitrarily large, the second a sequence of negative numbers that get arbitrarily large and negative, and the third a sequence of numbers of alternating sign that get arbitrarily large.   Our geometric definition of the absolute value function in terms of distance will be very important for conceptualizing calculus notions like limits, continuity, and derivatives. However, for computaitonal purposes it is convenient to have a more algebraic definition of the absolute value. Here the notion of a piecewise-defined function comes to our aid.   Absolute value (piecewise)   Given a real number , we definte its absolute value  as follows: . The function defined as is called the absolute value function .    Let's see how agrees with our previous geometric definition of the absolute value.   Absolute value (piecewise)   Use to compute the following.                             Since , we use the first case in to compute : .    Since , we use the second case in to compute : . This example illustrates how, despite the appearing in the formula for the second case of , the output of the absolute value function is always nonnegative.    Similarly, since , we use the second case in to compute : .    Lastly, the first case of the definition applies to , allowing us to compute .        Absolute value (piecewise)  As the last example illustrates, despite the formula appearing in the second case of the piecewise definition of , the output is always nonnegative. This is because the second case only applies if the the input is itself negative , in which case the output is positive !   With two separate definitions of the absolute value in play, the question naturally arises whether they agree! The last example gives evidence to the fact that they do. Here is how to see this more generally. For any real number , we can write or , where is a nonnegative number. Since defines in cases, it is natural to look at the two cases and separately.  If for some nonnegative number , then it lies a distance of to the right of , and hence we should have according to . Using , we have , as desired. Thus we see that the two definitions agree in this case.  The other case is similar. Suppose for some nonnegative number . In this case lies a distance of to the left of , and hence has absolute value according to . We get the same result using , since .  This arguing by case can be seen at work in the proof of the next result, which among other things, shows that the absolute value function is in fact an algebraic function!   Absolute value function is algebraic   For all we have . It follows that the absolute value function is algebraic.    First observe that identity implies that is algebraic as it can written as a composition of two power functions. We will use to prove the identity, and thus argue the two cases and separately.   Case:  Assume . First observe that by definition is the unique nonnegative square-root of . Since is clearly a square-root of , and since , we have , as desired.    Case:  Now assume . Since is a square-root of and is positive, we have in this case , as desired.      Identities involving   It is a very common error, among students and instructors alike, to omit the absolute value in the identity and erroneously simplify the expression to . To see why this is invalid, it is enough to consider the example : . The example also illustrates what exactly the issue is here: the principal square root function always picks out the nonnegative square root of its input. In particular, its output can never be negative. This alone guarantees that .  One explanation for the prevalence of this error is that in many cases it is tacitly assumed that is nonnegative, in which case the identity holds without the absolute value since for all .  The moral of the story is that the validity of a given identity depends very much on the precise scope of its application. Put another way, the quantifier expression for all satisfying... plays a very important role in the statement of the identity. Sometimes, when stating an identity, we will include this quantifier expression for clarity. For example, here are two correct identities involving a similar equality, but different scopes of application: .   The identity allows us to derive many useful properties of the absolute value function from those of the principal square-root function. Furthermore, knowing now that , we can make use of and to deterimine solutions to inequalities involving the absolute value. We include these results here in one compendium result. We will spare you the details of a proof, but invite you to think on your own about how you would proves these facts.   Properties of absolute value      We have for all , and for all with .  In plain English: the absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values, and the absolute value of a quotient is the quotient of the absolute values.    For any , we have .        Absolute value algebra   Solve the given equation or inequality.                   We use the property : .    We solve as follows: . Here the last line follows from a sign analysis of (or alternatively, by constructing a sign diagram) and the fact that for all , and hence never satisfies . We conclude that the solution set is .       Before moving on to graphs of functions involving absolute value, we generalize our distance formula to a notion of distance between any two points on the real line.   Distance function on   Let . We define the distance  between and to be . Geometrically, is the length of the line segment between and , considered as points on the real line.     Distance function on  The notion of distance between points on the real line will be used extensively in our development of calculus. This in turn is why a solid understanding of the absolute value function is so important. We content ourselves with a few short comments.   Note that our definition generalizes the distance to 0 formula, since for any we have .    The fact that is the length of the line segment between and can be shown to follow from using a nice shift argument . By way of illustration, consider and . Shifting these points to the right by three units yields new points and . Shifting the two points this way does not change the distance between them: , . It follows that , as claimed.    Fix a point on the real line. The closeness or farness of a variable point to is measured by its distance . Thus we have .        Graphs of absolute values  It remains only to consider the graph of , and more generally, graphs of functions involving absolute value.

Thus the graph of is given by the graph of the line for all and the line for all . This gives rise to the vee-shaped graph in .   Graph of   Graph of absolute value function     More generally, how do we graph a function of the form ? We can analyze this question using the piecewise definition of absolute value, along with our graphical interpretation of the scaling transformation.

Since the graph of is the result of reflecting the graph of over the -axis, we see that can be obtained by beginning with the graph of and flipping all portions of the graph where .

Give an informal definition of one-sided limits.    Express existence of two-sided limit in terms of one-sided limits.    Determine one-sided limits from a graph or table.      Informal definition of the limit  Many of the questions we will study in regard to functions revolve around how the output of a function changes with respect to its input. As such we want to develop useful and precise language and tools for describing this relation. The limit of a function, defined informally here and rigorously later, is one such tool. Before getting to its informal definition, we illustrate with a graphical example the type of statements we wish to formalize with limit language.   Function behavior   Suppose is the function whose graph is given below.   Graph of function   Graph of complicated function     Describe how the output behaves as the input approaches each of the values . For some of these values, you might consider how approaches from the left and right separately.    As approaches , either from the left or right, the values of the function get arbitrarily large and negative.  As approaches from the left, the values of get closer and closer to . However, as approaches from the right, the values get closer and closer to .  As approaches from the left or right, the values of the function approach the real number . We also happen to have : , the value of at is equal to .  As approaches from the left, the values of the function approach . However, as approaches from the right, the values oscillate wildly above and below and do not seem to approach any single value.  As approaches from the left or right, the values of the function approach . Interestingly, however, the actual value of at the input is not equal to .    As illustrates, an English description of how a function behaves for inputs near a given value can be quite a mouthful. Consider the limit notation introduced below as a means of making these descriptions much more concise. Roughly speaking, we will write to say that the values of approach as the input appraoches . This is the basic gist of , though it takes a little more care in the setup.   Limit (informal)   Suppose is a function defined everywhere on an open interval containing the point , except possibly at itself. We say that the limit of as approaches exists if there is a value such that the function value can be made arbitrarily close to provided is sufficiently close (but not equal) to .  When this is the case, we call the limit of as approaches and write . When the limit does not exist we will say that does not exist.     Limit definition (informal)  You might be thinking that our so-called informal limit definition has quite a formal ring to it. What prevents it from being a rigorous, formal definition? The issue lies precisely in making mathematical sense of the phrases arbitrarily close and sufficiently close . As intuitive as those notions may seem, we need a precise mathematical definition of them if we have any hope of building a theory on solid foundations. That is the motivation behind our formal definition , which we will meet soon.    Limit description of graph   Let be the function with graph given in . Use the language and notation of limits to describe the behavior of for inputs near the values .    The limit does not exist. There is no value that approaches for inputs sufficiently close to . Indeed, as gets arbitrarily close to , becomes arbitrarily large and negative.  The limit does not exist. If is arbitrarily close to , and less than (to the left), then the values gets arbitrarily close to ; thus if the limit existed it would have to be equal to . And yet for inputs arbitrarily close to but greater than (to the right), the values are greater than : , they get no closer than a distance of from the value . This implies is not the limit, and hence that no limit exists.  We have . Since , we have in this case.  The limit does not exist. See the explanation in .  We have . Note that in this case is an element of the domain and .     Limit as compared to value   Provide graphs of the following functions on their entire implied domain: . For each function discuss the limit behavior at as compared with the value of the function at .    The domain of is . Since for all , the graph of is the line for all . Similar reasoning for and yields the graphs below.     Graph of   Graph of f      Graph of   Graph of g        Graph of   Graph of h         The basic idea behind the limit is to observe how the outputs change as the input approaches some value , written for short. As we saw above, a detailed graph can give a strong indication of whether the values approach some fixed value . This type of behavior can also be made evident by a sufficiently detailed table of values.   Limits: using table of values   Consider the function . You can verify for your self that is a root of the denominator of , and hence that is not defined at .   What does the table of values below suggest about ? Do you think the limit exists? If so, estimate its value.   Table of values of                           Perform some algebra on to get a better idea of what is for . Does this algebra suggest a potential exact value for ?          First note that the table provides values for inputs that get reasonably close to : from the left, we have the sequence of inputs , and from the right we have the sequence . The closest inputs included in the table are and , which are a distance of away from . Moreover, we notice that as these inputs get closer to , the outputs seem to approach a value between and . Thus, we are inclined to believe that the limit does indeed exist, and that . In fact, since the values decrease as approaches from the left, and increase as approaches from the right, we might further guess that . Notice, however, that that guess would be conditioned on the assumption that is decreasing for all sufficiently close to on the left, and all sufficiently close to on the right; and this is an assumption we are not in a position to verify at the moment.    We can factor the denominator of as , which means that we have for all in the domain of . Let . Since for all , the limit behaviors of the two functions are the same at . Note that is defined at and satisfies . Wait a minute, that looks a whole lot like our estimate of in part (a)! Are we in a position to say with assurance that Not quite yet, but the evidence is stacking up. We could conclude this if we knew that . This seems like it should be true since is actually defined at and we have seen that rational functions behave nicely around points in their domain. Soon we will have a more precise way of saying this that will give us the answer we desire.         One-sided limits  Let's look at the limit behavior of the sign function near . (See .) Since the function is defined piecwise, it is natural to look at the behavior for and separately. Since for all , we conclude that approaches for all sufficiently close to and lying to its right . Similarly, we see that approaches for all sufficiently close to and lying to its left . Wouldn't it be nice if we had some notation to capture this from the left and from the right behavior? The notion of one-sided limits , defined below, gives us just what we need. In particular, using its notation, we can say more succinctly that . Before getting to that definition, let's finish our analysis of the behavior of near . Since the values of approach two distinct values ( and ), depending on whether approaches from the right or left, we conclude that there is no single value that values approach as gets sufficiently close to , and hence that does not exist. (We make this reasoning more official in .)   One-sided limits: informal   Let be a function, and let .   Left-hand limit  Assume is defined on an open interval of the form . We say the left-hand limit of as approaches from the left exists if there is a value such that can be made arbitrarily close to provided is sufficiently close to and lying to its left.  When this is the case we call the left-hand limit of as approaches from the left, and write . When no such exists, we say that the left-hand limit does not exist.    Right-hand limit  Assume is defined on an open interval of the form . We say the right-hand limit of as approaches from the right exists if there is a value such that can be made arbitrarily close to provided is sufficiently close to and lying to its right.  When this is the case we call the right-hand limit of as approaches from the right, and write . When no such exists, we say that the right-hand limit does not exist.        Visualizing one-sided limits   Suppose is the function whose graph is given below.   Graph of function   Graph of complicated function     Describe the behavior of near the inputs , , , and using one-sided limit notation.       Neither nor exists, since the function values get arbitrarily large (and negative) as approaches from either side.   We have . Thus in this case the left- and right-handed limits of both exist, but do not agree.  We have . By contrast, does not exist as the values of oscillate wildly as approaches from the right.  We have .      As was suggested by and made official by the next theorem, exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal.   One-sided limits test   Suppose is a function defined everywhere on an open interval containing the point , except possibly at itself. The limit exists if and only if the following conditions hold.   The one-sided limits and exist.     .   When this the case, we have .  As a consequence, if one of the one-sided limits does not exist, or if both one-sided limits exist but are not equal to one another, then the limit does not exist.     is particularly useful in that it gives us a convenient means of showing that a limit does not exist. Let's apply this theorem to some of our previous examples and see how it simplifies things.  Looking again at the sign function, we see that the left and right limits do indeed exist, but are not equal: we have . Since , we conclude that does not exist.  Now return to the function whose graph is given in , and let's see how we can apply at some of the limit points. Since , we conclude that does not exist. By contrast since , we conclude that exists and that .  We end our section by extending somewhat our definition of the limit. Previously our definition of limit only applied to points for which the function was defined for all on an open interval containing . The language of one-sided limits allows us to extend this definition to endpoints of the domain, as the next definition makes clear. guarantees that this definition is a consistent extension of .   Limit at endpoints of domain   Let be a function, and let .   Right endpoint  If is defined for all on an open interval , but not for all in a full open interval containing , then we say the limit of as approaches exists if exists. When this is the case, we define .    Left endpoint  If is defined for all on an open interval , but not for all in a full open interval containing , then we say the limit of as approaches exists if exists. When this is the case, we define .        "

Understand that a limit rule can only be applied subjecto to certain restrictions.    See examples where limit rules are not sufficient for computing a limit.      Limit rules  We now state some useful limit formulas and rules. These will give us a means of breaking down the limit computation of a complicated function into limits of simpler functions. Technically speaking we must prove the validity of each of these rules and formulas; however this would be a fool's errand until we have a rigorous definition of the limit to work with! Such a definition will be provided in the near future, though even then we will not concern ourselves overly with proofs; we are more interested in learning how to make valid use of the rules.  Our first theorem gives us two simple formulas for computing the limits of particular types of functions: constant functions, and the identity function.   Constant and identity function formulas      Constant function formula  Fix a real number and let be the constant function defined as for all . Given any we have .    Identity function formula  Let be the identity function defined as for all . Given any we have .

Limit rules  It is useful to think of as giving us a bunch of algebraic rules for computing limits of functions defined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For the most part these rules tell us that we can bring the limit into various operations: for example, the first two rules tell us that we can bring the limit into sums and differences of functions. Or better, using plain English, they tell us that the limit of a sum (of functions) is the sum of the limits, and that the limit of a difference (of functions) is the difference of the limits.  In fact most of the rules in can be nicely summarized in plain English ( , the limit of a product is the product of the limits , the limit of an -th power is the -th power of the limit ), and these summaries are helpful for remembering how the limit interacts with function operations.    Quotient rule  Assume as in that and exist and consider the limit . Mark well that we can only make use of the quotient rule if , in which case we can conclude that the limit of the quotient is the quotient of the limits.  Note further that in the case where , we cannot automatically conclude that the limit does not exist; it simply the case that we cannot make use of the quotient rule to evaluate this limit. When this happens, we must look to other means for investigating the limit. See .    Using limit rules   Compute the following limits. Your answer should be a chain of equalities with steps justified.                             We have .    We have .    We have .    We have .       You may have noticed in the last example that although we had to apply several limit rules before we could compute , when in the end the value of that limit was simply the result of evaluating the polynomial at : , in the end we found that . Using the integer power rule, scalar multiplication rule, and sum rule in sequence, it is easy to see that the same is true for any polynomial . This is the fundamental idea behind the polynomial evaluation formula in the theorem below. Throwing the quotient rule into the mix, we can immediately generalize this result to rational functions, since these are just quotients of polynomials. Indeed, give a rational function , we have , as long as . This shows how the rational function evaluation formula follows from the polynomial evaluation formula . We make these two evaluation formulas official in the form of a theorem.   Polynomial and rational function evaluation      Polynomial evaluation  Let be a polynomial. Given any , we have .    Rational evaluation  Let and be polynomials. For any satisfying , we have .        Polynomial and rational function evaluation   Give a simplified computation of the limit from .    Since is a rational function, and since the denominator polynomial satisfies , we may apply the rational function evaluation formula: .     Rational function evaluation  As useful as is, mark well the restriction on its application: we can only use this evaluation rule (currently) on polynomials and rational functions . below is a nice illustration of this limitation. As tempted as we might be to compute the limit simply by evaluating the function at , we currently have no evaluation rule that allows us to do so directly. We had to use limit rules to simplify the limit expression to a point where we could apply the polynomial evaluation formula.    Using limit rules  Compute the limit below. Your answer should be a chain of equalities with steps justified.     .     Limit rules and limit formulas  It is useful to distinguish between limit rules and limit formulas . The various limit rules given in gives us a means of reducing a complicated limit computation to a sequence of simpler limit computations. At some point, however, we have to be able to compute these limits!  This is where our limit formulas come into play. Currently the polynomial and rational function evaluation formulas are our most powerful means of computing limits. Notice that these formulas subsume the formulas for constant functions and identity functions given in , as constant functions and the identity function are both examples of polynomials (of degree 0 and 1, respectively).  Why do we call these limit formulas evaluation formulas? The formulas for polynomials and rational functions are both of the form . These formulas instruct us to compute the limit simply by computing evaluating the function at : that is, by evaluating the function at the limit point . Currently we only have evaluation formulas for polynomials and rational functions, but soon we will be able to extend this to a vastly larger class of functions: namely, to all continuous functions . Stay tuned.   We end this section with one more limit rule related to the absolute value function. The proof of this result serves as another example of using limit rules.   Absolute value evaluation   Assume exists. We have .    We will derive this rule by using the identity for all . We have , as claimed.     "

  "body": " Assessing application of limit rules  The example of this section suggest the following general strategy for computing limits:   First assess whether the given limit can be computed using limit rules. This usually amounts to checking mentally that the limits of component functions actually exist, and no zeros appear in the denominator.    If it is clear that we cannot simply apply limit rules, try using algebra in combination with the replacement rule to simplify the limit to a form where limit rules and evaluation formulas can be applied.  In this case the particular form of the given function often suggests a particular algebraic technique to try: , factoring, clearing denominators, or simplifying radical expressions.     "

Understand the quantifier logic underlying the formal definition of a limit in a challenge and response manner.    Use the formal definition of the limit to compute a limit and\/or decide whether a limit exists.

The epsilon-delta formulation given in is a mathematically precise way of capturing these notions.

In particular, choosing to be as small as you like, we have within that small distance of for all sufficiently close to . In other words, we can make  arbitrarily close to for all sufficiently close (but not equal) to .       Challenge and response  It is useful to think of the process of verifying to establish a limit claim as a challenge and response type of procedure.

To meet a specific epsilon-challenge we respond by providing a for which implies . Consider this proffered our delta-response that meets the given epsilon-challenge.   Note that the we provide in response to a particular epsilon-challenge will typically depend on the particular in question. Indeed, we typically see that the smaller the , the smaller the .   Let's see this challenge-response nature of the formal definition of the limit in action. We choose a linear function for our first example.   Epsilon-delta: linear function   Let . Verify that using the epsilon-delta definition of the limit.    We approach the problem in the spirit of the challenge-response characterization given in . Given an arbitrary epsilon-challenge of , we seek to respond with a suitable that meets the challenge: , we wish to find a that guarantees for all .  To do so, we work backwards.

Interval of radius centered at   Centered interval at a with radius d       Epsilon-delta definition  Note that our polynomial evaluation rule could have been applied to the previous example, since the function is a polynomial (of degree 1). Indeed, using that rule, we have , in agreement with . So what is the purpose of that example? It is important to note that all of the rules in , including the polynomial evaluation rule, were stated without proof . Using the delta-epsilon definition in a particular example gives us a rigorous proof that the result obtained via limit rules is correct.  Going further, it is possible to give, for each limit rule and formula of , a general proof of its validity using the epsilon-delta definition. Outside of epsilon-delta examples, proofs are not an official topic of this course. For the curious, however, checkout for an example of how we use the epsilon-delta definition to prove limit rules.   It is possible to give a graphical interpretation of the challenge-response nature of the epsilon-delta definition, and this might help you understand all the logical subtleties of the formal definition pointed out in .   Visualizing epsilon-delta definition  The Geogebra interactive below provides a means of visualizing the challenge-response nature of the epsilon-delta proof of a limit claim in terms of the graph of . (The window below is a bit narrow. Go to the Geogebra page of the interactive for a larger rendition.) Let's elaborate on how exactly to parse this graphical representation.   The specific -challenge is indicated by a horizontal band centered about .    The -response is indicated by a vertical band centered about .    The game, given a specific -challenge, is to find an appropriate such that when is within of , the values are within of . Visually, this is accomplished when all points on the segment of the graph of lying in the vertical band about also lie within the horizontal band about .      Visualizing epsilon-delta proofs. Made with Geogebra     Before moving on to further examples of the epsilon-delta definition it will be worthwhile to fomulate a systematic approach to its application. The steps we used in can be summarized by the more general procedure below.   Epsilon-delta proof for limits   To prove using the epsilon-delta definition, proceed as follows.   Treating as an arbitrary positive constant, solve the inequality for . That is, find the set of all satisfying . This set is typically a union of one or more intervals.    Find a positive such that the set of solutions to contains the interval , with the possible exception of itself. The you provide will be expressed in terms of .    It follows that . Since was arbitrary, conclude that .        Finding such that  In the final step of applying to a limit statement , we usually have found an open interval containing , and then must find a such that . The following approach is useful in this regard. Observe that and thus , where , are the distances from to the left and right endpoints of the interval.   Visualizing distances to endpoints of interval   Visualizing distances to endpoints of interval     Setting as the minimum of these distances, we now have , as desired.  Depending on the example, we can sometimes easily determine which of and is the minimum, giving us an explicit expression for . When things are too complicated, however, it is perfectly fine to set .    Epsilon-delta: radical function   Let . Verify that using the epsilon-delta definition of the limit.    Following we treat as an arbitrary positive constant and attempt to solve the inequality . We have . We are tempted now to square all terms in the above inequality to get rid of the radical, but recall that in order for the rule to apply, we need and to both be nonnegative. (Example: , but .) To deal with this, we will treat two separate cases: and .   Case:  When , all terms in the last inequality above are positive, and we may continue on to conclude . Thus the set of solutions to our original inequality, assuming , is , where . Note that since , both and are positive. It is clear that . Setting to be the minimum of , guarantees that . We conclude that for any positive , setting , we have for all satisfying .  Note: in fact, it is not difficult to see in this case that and so we could have more explicitly set in this case. Nonetheless, declaring works just as well here, as well as in other examples.    Case:  Now assume . We need to find a such that implies . From the previous case ( ), we know there is a such that implies . But since , we have , as desired.   Our two cases, taken together, show that for all , there exists a such that . Thus .    As the last example illustrates, as our function becomes more complicated, solving the relevant inequality can be a delicate and difficult affair. Mindful of this fact, instead of asking you to give a full epsilon-delta proof of a given limit claim, we will sometimes ask you to give a partial proof: namely we will give you one specific as a challenge, and ask you to find a that satisfies for this particular .   Finding for specific : quadratic function   Let . It is a fact that . Verify the epsilon-delta definition for this limit statement for the specific epsilon .    We wish to find satisfying . Proceeding as in , we first solve the inequality : . Notice that in this case, the set of solutions to the inequality is a union of two intervals: . Notice further that our limit point is an element of the second interval, and that we have , where . Thus, setting , we have . It follows that , as desired.    We finish the section with an example illustrating how to use the epsilon-delta definition of the limit to give a rigorous proof of limit rules. As mentioned above, proving limit rules is not an official topic of this course. However, the argument given in the solution below might help further illuminate how the epsilon-delta definition works. We will make use of the famous triangle inequality for the absolute value, which we make official here.   Triangle inequality   For all we have . Furthermore, equality holds above if and only if , which is equivalent to and not having different signs.    There are a number of different ways of proving the triangle inequality. We will give a proof making use of the identity . First observe that since both sides of are nonnegative, we have , using . Now begin with . We have . We conclude that , and thus that , as desired. Where does the condition for inequality in come from? Notice that the chain of equalities above is a chain of equalities if and only if the middle inequality, which uses is an equality. This in turn is true if and only if , which is equivalent to saying that and do not have different signs.     Proof of the sum rule for limits   Use the epsilon-delta definition of the limit to prove the . That is, show that if and exist, then exists and satisfies .    Let and . We use the epsilon-delta definition to show that .  Given an arbitrary , we must find a such that for all satisfying . Since , we can find positive numbers and such that for all satisfying and . What's going on here? The and are our responses to the the epsilon challenge of to the statements and . You will see below, why we chose an epsilon challenge of here.  Letting it follows that both inequalities in hold for all satisfying . We claim this is the response we want to the given challenge to the limit statement . Indeed for all satisfying , we have . This proves that given any there is a such that for all satisfying , and hence that .    "

Understand how the continuity property is preserved under familiar function operations, including composition. Show that all algebraic functions are continuous at every point in their domain.    Argue using the intermediate value theorem that a function achieves a given value, and that a given equation has a solution in a specified interval.     In this section we explore the notion of continuity of a function. The definition of continuity is most clearly stated in terms of limits: a function is continuous at a point in its domain if its limit exists there and is equal to its value . Graphically, this means, roughly speaking that the graph of has no untoward behavior at : , there are no jumps or asymptotes at , nor any wild oscillations near . As we will see, the property of being continuous at points has many important and useful consequences, including the famous .   Continuous functions  Before getting to the official definition of a continuity, we quickly indulge in some technicalities around the notions of interior points and endpoints of domains.   Interior points and endpoints   Let be a function with domain .   Interior point  An element is an interior point of if contains an open interval that contains : , and .    Endpoints  An element is a left endpoint of if it is not an interior point of and contains an interval of the form .  An element is a right endpoint of if it is not an interior point of and contains an interval of the form . with .  An element is an endpoint of if it is either left or right endpoint.        Continuity   Let be a function with domain , and suppose is either an interior point or an endpoint of . The function is continuous at if the limit of at exists and is equal to the value of at : , if    exists, and     .   The function is discontinuous at if it is not continuous there.  For a subset , we say is continuous on if is continuous at all interior or endpoint points of lying in . We say is continuous if it is continuous on its entire domain.     Continuity at  Let be a function with domain . Observe that our definition of continuity (and discontinuity) only applies to elements of the domain. (In fact, it only applies to elements of the domain that are either interior points or endpoints.)  For example, consider the function with domain . Since is not an element of the domain of , we do not say that is continuous or discontinuous at .    Endpoints  Let be a function with domain , and let be a right endpoint of . Since by definition contains an interval of the form but not a full open interval containing , we are in a situation where only the left limit of is defined at . Recall ( ) that we define in this case. A similar remark applies to left endpoints of .    Continuity at endpoint   Let , with domain . Decide whether is continuous at .    First observe that since is a left endpoint of , we define . We compute . Thus exists and is equal to 0. Since , we see further that and thus that is continuous at .     Continuity: graphical  When scanning the graph of a function for points of continuity or discontinuity, we look for problem points . These are locations on the graph where either (a) the limit of the function appears not to exist, or (b) where the limit does exist but does not agree with the value of the function.  A well-loved adage in this regard is the phrase a continuous function is one whose graph can be traced without lifting the pencil . This is cute, and helpful for guidance, but should not be taken too literally. Indeed, there are some pretty wacky continuous functions out there. For example, the function is continuous everywhere on its domain, and yet there are some peculiar properties of its graph that make it unclear it what sense it could be traced by a pencil . (Not having defined the sine function yet, we have gotten a little ahead of ourselves. The reader is invited to graph the function above using technology.)    Continuity: graphical   For the function whose graph is given below, find all points of discontinuity and explain what conditions of fail to attain. Make use of some of the following descriptors of discontinuities: jump , removeable , oscillating , infinite .   Graph of function   Graph of complicated function       Note that we do not speak of being continuous or discontinuous at , as this is not an element of the domain of .  The limit of at does not exist, since the left limit does not equal the right limit ( ). Thus (i) of fails, and is not continuous at . Such a discontinuity is called a jump discontinuity , as the difference between the left- and right-hand limit values is manifested graphically as a discrete jump in the height of the graph of .  The limit of at exists, and is equal to the value of at : that is, we have . Thus (i) and (ii) of are satisfied, and is continuous at .  The limit of at does not exist, since the right-hand limit does not exist. Thus (i) of fails, and is not continuous at . Such a discontinuity is called an oscillating discontinuity , as the wild oscillation is the reason why the limit does not exist.  The limit of exists at , but is not equal to the value of at . In more detail, we have . Thus is not continuous at . Such a discontinuity is called a removeable discontinuity as a simple redefining of at ( , setting ) would make the discontinuity disappear.     Continuous everywhere   Let . Prove, using that is continuous.    Let be any interior element in the implied domain of . By definition of this domain, this means . It follows that . This computation shows both that (i) exists, and (ii) , and thus by , that is continuous at . Since was an arbitrary element of the domain of , we conclude that is continuous at all points of its domain, and hence continuous.    Next we state some theorems that facilitate our (non-graphical) analysis of continuity for a given function. The first result establishes the continuity of some familiar families, proving us with a basic collection of continuous functions.   Continuous functions      Absolute value  The function is continuous everywhere on its domain. In other words, the absolute value function is a continuous function.    Polynomials and rational functions  If is either a polynomial or a rational function, then is continuous everywhere on its domain. In other words, polynomials and rational functions are continuous functions.          This is a direct consequence of and .    This is a direct consequence of and .       By contrast, our next two theorems give us rules for building new continuous functions out of old ones, allowing us to build up our collection of continuous functions.   Continuity rules   Assume and are both continuous at the point .   Linear combination  For all constants , the function is continuous at .    Product  The function is continuous at .    Quotient  Assume further that . The function is continuous at .    Power  Let be a positive integer. The function is continuous at .    Root rule  Let be a positive integer. If is even, assume further that . The function is continuous at .        Continuity composition rule   Assume and are functions, and suppose the range of is a subset of the domain of . If , and if is continuous at , then .  It follows that if is continuous at , then the composition is continuous at .    Whereas establishes the continuity of some basic families of functions, and tell us that continuity is preserved by all of our familiar function operations (sum, product, quotient, composition, etc.)! As a result, just about any function we build from our starting collection of polynomials and rational functions, is continuous on its entire domain. Since the set family of functions that can be build up from polynomials in this way is precisely the set of algebraic functions , we conclude that all algebraic functions are continuous!   Algebraic functions are continuous   All algebraic functions are continuous. In more detail, if is an algebraic function with domain , then is continuous at all interior points and endpoints of .    By definition of continuity, is continuous at if and only if . Now that we know that any algebraic functions is continuous everywhere on their domain, we obtain a sort of super-powered evaluation formula generalizing : namely, the algebraic evaluation formula.   Algebraic function evaluation   If is an algebraic function with domain , then for all .    As a result of most of the ``easy\" limit computations ( , limit computations that do not require algebra) we considered in now become extremely easy, as long as the function in question is algebraic, and the limit point is in that function's domain. Do be careful of that last restriction, however. If is not in the domain of , then we cannot use , and probably need to resort to algebraic techniques.   Algebraic function evaluation   Let . Compute the following limits.                We first observe that is algebraic, with domain .   Since is algebraic and , we may use to compute .    Note that , and thus we cannot use . As usual we resort to some algebra: .       In light of , we see that it is actually somewhat difficult to write down a discontinuous function! Piecewise-defined functions give us an easy way of getting around this issue, providing us with a useful source of functions that potentially have discontinuities. Of course, being defined in a piecewise manner does not guarantee the existence of a continuity; consider for the example the absolute value function , which is continuous, but defined piecewise as . The example below illustrates in general how we determine whether a piecewise-defined function is continuous at various inputs.   Continuity: piecewise   Let be defined as , where is a fixed constant.   Argue that is continuous at all inputs .    Find all values of for which is continuous at the input , and hence everywhere.          Take any with .  If , then for inputs near . Since is a polynomial, and since polynomials are continuous on their domain, it follows that is continuous at .  Similarly, if , then for inputs near . Again since is a polynomial, it is continuous at all such inputs, and hence also at .  This shows that is continuous at for all , no matter what the value of .    We use the definition of continuity to see what must satisfy for to be differentiable at . Namely, this is true if and only if    exists, and further        Condition (i) holds if and only if . We compute both one-sided limits: . We see that (i) is satisfied if and only if , or , which is true if and only if or .  It remains to determine which choices of guarantee condition (ii). We claim that both work: indeed, since both and guarantee that , and since using the piecewise definition, we conclude that for both choices of we have , as desired.   The figure below shows the resulting graph for , taking and . You can think of condition (i) as guaranteeing that our two linear segments join up correctly at .   Graphs of : and      Graph of piecewise-defined function        Graph of piecewise-defined function           Intermediate value theorem  Recall the cute informal description of a continuous function as one whose graph can be traced without lifting your pencil. This can be further interpreted as saying that as we trace a segment of the graph lying over some interval in the -axis, it should not be possible to skip over a particular -value. Indeed, to skip this value, we would have to lift our pencil. This seems plausible, starting from our cutesy informal description of continuity, but can we prove it rigorously? Yes, we can as witnessed by the intermediate value theorem .   Intermediate value theorem (IVT)   Let be continuous on the closed interval . If , then given any value lying strictly between and , there is an element such that .     IVT and existence of solutions  A common application of the IVT is to prove that an equation of the form has a solution in a given open interval . Indeed, if is continuous on , and if lies strictly between and , then the IVT guarantees the existence of an element satisfying .  Interestingly, however, this method does not actually provide the solution ; it only tells us that it exists. This is probably the first time you have encountered what is called a nonconstructive proof in mathematics. The theorem tells us that the value exists (assuming the necessary conditions hold), but does not explicitly tell us what is.    Roots of polynomials   Show that the polynomial has a root.    A root of is an input satisfying . Since is continuous everywhere, the IVT will guarantee the existence of such a as long as we can find inputs , satisfying and . Let's make a table of values of for small inputs : . This so far is not helpful to us, as all the values are positive. Let's try another negative value: . That's more like it! Since is continuous on , and since , the IVT now implies there is a such that .  Observe that this not only shows that has a real root, it tells us further that there is a root lying between -2 and -1. Are there any other roots of this function? Further investigation is required. We will have the tools to answer this later.     IVT for an algebraic function   Prove that the equation has a solution.    Define . The function is algebraic and hence continuous on its domain, which is . Observe that . Since is continuous on and since , the intermediate value theorem implies that there is an element satisfying . Setting gives us a solution to the original equation .     Sign diagram technique  At long last we are able to justify , which was the basis of , our sign diagram technique for solving inequalities. The crucial claim was that given an algebraic function and an interval on which is defined and never equal to zero, is either always positive or always negative on . Let's see how the intermediate value theorem implies this fact.  Assume is an algebraic function, and that the interval is a subset of the domain of : , is defined at all points in . If assumes both positive and negative values on , then we can find points such that , and and have different signs ( , one is positive and the other is negative). But since is algebraic , it is continuous, which means in particular that it is continuous at all points in , and hence also on the interval . We now apply the intermediate value theorem: since the signs of and are different, lies between and , and thus there is a such that . We have shown that if an algebraic function changes sign on an interval in its domain, then it must have a zero in that interval. Equivalently, an algebraic function cannot change sign on an interval in its domain on which it is never equal to zero.   Looking at the argument in , we see that we don't need our function to be algebraic for , we only need that it is continuous . Thus we have the following more general result.   Constancy of sign: continuous functions   Assume is continuous on the interval . If contains no zeros of , then is either always positive or always negative on .  As a result, can be applied to any continuous function.     "

Introduce valid rules and formulas for limits at infinity.    Evaluate limits at infinity using limit rules and formulas.    Define horizontal asymptotes using language of limits at infinity.     We motivated the introduction of limit notation as a useful and precise way of describing the behavior of the values of a function as its inputs approach a fixed real number . It is natural to ask, however, how the values of vary as inputs move off to infinity in the positive or negative direction. For example, suppose the number of sales of a product is given as a function , where is the number of days since the product's introduction to the market. Naturally, a sales team would be interested in what happens to as goes to infinity. The definition below makes rigorous sense of this going to infinity business. Notice that it is not so very different than our usual epsilon-delta definition of the limit.   Limits at infinity      Limit at  Suppose is defined on an open interval of the form . We say that the limit of at positive infinity (or at ) exists if there is a value satisfying the following property: for all , there exists a such that if , then . Using logical shorthand: . When this is the case, we call the limit of as approaches positive infinity (or ), and write .    Limit at  Suppose is defined on an open interval of the form .

When this is the case, we call the limit of as approaches negative infinity (or ), and write .        Limits at infinity: informal  Informally, we have if we can make arbitrarily close to for all inputs that are sufficiently large and positive. It is useful to think of the in the formal definition as a large positive number such that is guaranteed to be within of for all is greater than ( , to the right of) .  Similarly, we have if we can make arbitrarily close to for all inputs that are sufficiently large and negative. In this case, it is useful to think of the in the formal definition as a large negative number such that is guaranteed to be within of for all less than ( , to the left of) .    At infinity versus at a point  The limit at infinity notation is very similar to the limit at a point notation: . That said, do not make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow treating infinity as if it were an actual real number. Think of our new notation as an extended version of our old notation. The in the subscript is just a sort of shorthand for saying as gets sufficiently large and positive . In fact, so useful is this shorthand, that you will see us use it frequently on its own, outside of the limit notation.   Graphically speaking, if , then the -values of points on the graph of will get closer and closer to , as . This means the graph of will get arbitrarily close to the horizontal line for points lying further and further to the right. A similar observation holds if the limit at exists. This is illustrated in for the graph of a function that satisfies .   Graph of function satisfying and   Graph of function with horizontal asymptotes     When a curve in the plane behaves in such a manner, we say that it has a horizontal asymptote. We give a formal definition of this below for the graph of a function, using limit-at-infinity notation.   Horizontal asymptote   The line is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of a function if or .    The existence or nonexistence of horizontal asymptotes for the graph of a function gives us an easy visual way of deciding whether limits at infinity exist.  Fix a positive integer and define as . We recall that the graph of such a function looks like one of the graphs in , depending on whether is even or odd.   Graphs of , for positive integer .    odd   Graph of reciprocal power function      even   Graph of reciprocal power function       In all cases we see that the graph of any such function has both as a right and left asymptote. This suggests that . The theorem below makes this observation official, as well as providing an obvious limit at infinity formula for constant functions.   Limit at infinity formulas      Constant function formula  Fix a real constant , and let be the constant function for all . We have .    Let , where is a positive integer. We have .        Limit at infinity laws  It is not so surprising that at infinity limits satisfy at infinity versions of the limit rules in .

Define vertical asymptotes using language of infinite limits.    Develop computation techniques for infinite limits.     As a complement to our limit at infinity discussion, we follow up with a treatment of infinite limits . Whereas previously we introduced the notation in order to describe the behavior of a function as the input of the function gets arbitrarily large (in the positive or negative direction), now we wish to introduce notation that indicates that the values of the function get arbitrarily large (in the positive or negative direction).

We write (resp., ) when this is the case.        Infinite limits  It is important to observe that the various notions of infinite limit defined in all cover situations where the limit of the function does not exist . The best way to understand an infinite limit statement of the form , where denotes either a real number, , or , is as an assertion that   the limit in question does not exist, and    its failure to exist is due to values of the function getting arbitrarily large (in positive or negative direction) as approaches .   Accordingly, we must understand this new notation as an extended version of our original limit notation. In particular, we are not treating or here as if they were actual real numbers.    One-sided infinite limits  Yet more variants of infinite limits can be defined for one-sided limits: that is, we can make sense of the following statements for any : . We thought was long enough as it is.   Graphically speaking, if at a value , then the graph of will asymptotically approach the vertical line as gets arbitrarily close to . This motivates the following definition.   Vertical asymptote   Fix a constant . The line is a vertical asymptote of the graph of a function if at least one the of the following conditions holds: .    As with limits at infinity, we would like a starter kit of basic infinite limit formulas that we can build up from. The theorem below is a compendium of limits at infinity and infinite limit formulas for power functions and their reciprocals. Of course, this theorem, like all theorems technically requires proof. In this case, however, the statements of the theorem are essentially just limit notation translations of properties of the graphs of these familiar functions. (See and .)   Power functions and their reciprocals   Let be a positive integer.     The next theorem helps us to compute the limit of functions built from other functions that may have infinite limits. There are a lot of rules listed there, each equipped with a type name that will help you reference it. That said, each rule is the consequence of very elementary reasoning about the size of various quantities. Instead of trying to commit all of to memory, we encourage you instead to internalize this reasoning. For example, the fact that if and , then , follows from the simple fact that if the numerator is approaching some finite number as , while the denominator gets arbitrarily large, then the quotient is the result of taking a number very close to and dividing it by a very large positive number, which yields a very small positive number. Thus the limit is equal to 0: , .  All of the arguments behind the results of are of a similar elementary nature. The type descriptions of each result ( , , , ) should be thought of as helpful shorthand for the simple principles at work. You should use these in the parenthetical justifications of steps in an infinite limit computation.   Infinite limit rules   For some arithmetic combinations of functions with infinite limits, we can easily determine the resulting limit using a simple argument about size of quantities. We collect some of these results below. In what follows the limit point can be either a real number or . . In the type rule, the sign of the limit depends on the sign of and whether the limit of is or . Similarly, in the type rule, the sign of the limit depends on the sign of and the sign of as approaches .    Let's see how to write up our work when making use of the results of . The explanations in these situations tend to be slightly less streamlined than usual. This is in large part a result of the fact that in these situations we cannot make use of our usual limit rules ( , sum, product, quotient, ); and this is so precisely because those rules require that the limits involved exist!   Infinite limit   Compute the following limits. Your answer should be either a real number, , or .                   In this case a quick appraisal tells us that the limit in question will fall under type , and thus should be equal to , the basic principle being the following: the -th root of a very large negative number is a very large negative number. Here is how we can formally write this up. In this case we come right out and state the answer, indicating that this limit is of one of our known types: . We then provide justification for the claim that the limit is of the stated type. This can be done via a series of limit observations about component functions as follows:    ;     (type ), since and .       Note first that ( ), and (type ). Unfortunately, we do not have any infinite limit principles with descriptive type , so we cannot use any of the results of directly. Instead, we first do some algebra, using our intuition that the term dominates the term. We make this intuition precise by forcibly factoring out from the expression, in a way that allows us to recognize the type of the limit: , since and .        Determinate versus indeterminate forms  In part (b) of , we saw that the limit expression in its initial form was of type form . In contrast to the limit types of , the description alone is not sufficient for determining the limit. Why? In a limit of form , we have one term that is getting arbitrarily large and positive, and the other getting arbitrarily large and negative. That information alone, does not tell us what the limit behavior is. Indeed, in general the answer will depend on how quickly each term grows.  To make this more explicit consider the following three limits: . All three limits are of type , and yet we get three different answers. For this reason, limit types like are called indeterminate forms , because the information they convey is not sufficient for determining the limit. In contrast, the limit types appearing in are called determinate forms .  Below is a list of some common indeterminate forms to watch out for: . It is important to realize that if in the course of your analysis you encounter an indeterminate form, this does not necessarily mean that the limit in question does not exist. Instead, it means that your analysis thus far simply isn't detailed enough to provide an answer: , your investigation so far is inconclusive , and more work is required. For the time being that additional work will be algebraic in nature.   The technique used for the computations in can be summarized by the following rough procedure.   Infinite limit computation   To compute an infinite limit , with justification, follow the steps below.   If you cannot immediately identify the limit as one of the types of , do some algebraic manipulation. It may help to forcibly factor out terms that dominate the behavior of the function as .    Once you have identified the type of the infinite limit, compute the limit using and cite the limit type.    Below your computed limit, provide the necessary justification showing that the limit is indeed of the stated type. This typically involves computing limits of simpler functions that are used to construct . You may need to cite limit types and for some of these simpler limit computations as well.       Let's see this procedure in action with another example.   Infinite limits   Compute the following limit. Your answer should be a real number or . .    We have , since and thus .     End behavior of polynomials  The technique in part (b) of can be generalized to analyze the behavior of an arbitrary polynomial.  Let , where . Our intuition tells us that the leading term should dominate the other terms as . We make precise sense of this algebraically by forcibly factoring out . Namely, we write . Next, we compute . We conclude that is of type . It follows from that . However, the precise sign depends on the sign of and the sign of as . For example, we have , since as . As a shorthand, we write , and leave it to you to determine whether the last limit is or .   The argument above can be extended even further to compute limits at infinity of an arbitrary rational function .   Limit at infinity: rational functions   Assume we are given polynomials and , where and are nonzero constants.   Equal degree  If , then .    Denominator degree bigger  If , then .    Numerator degree bigger  If , then . Furthermore, both these limits are infinite. However, their sign depends on whether is positive or negative, and whether is even or odd. Alternatively, the sign of the limit depends on the limits of and at and , respectively.  Since both limits at infinity do not exist, does not have any horizontal asymptotes.       The next example will have us put to good use in the context of computing horizontal and vertical asymptotes of a rational function.   Asymptotes: rational function   Let . Find all and any horizontal and vertical asymptotes of . For any vertical asymptotes, compute both one-sided limits.    For our horizontal asymptote investigation we compute the limits at infinity of . At we have since , and is negative eventually as .  At we have since , and is positive eventually as .  Since is algebraic, the possible vertical asymptotes are of the form , where is not in the domain of . We have . From this we see that the only candidates for vertical asymptotes are the lines and . We investigate the limits at these points: . Since the limit exists at , the line is not a vertical asymptote.  We now compute the one-sided limits at . We have , since , , and is positive for all close to and less than . Since once of the one-sided limits is infinite, we conclude that is a vertical asymptote of the graph of .  We are asked to compute the other one-sided limit. The computation is similar: , since , , and is negative for all close to and greater than .     End behavior of rational functions  Note well the important restriction imposed in : namely, this can only be applied to limits at infinity of rational functions . Do not assume that it can be applied to any quotient of functions!  For example, we cannot apply to the limit , since this function is not rational. However, the same approach of forcibly factoring out a dominating term can be used: .   "

Whereas previously we focused on the notion of the derivative of a function at a specific input, we now switch perspectives somewhat and consider the derivative operation as defining a function associated to .   Derivative function   Let be a function, and let be the set of points where is differentiable. The derivative operation defines a function that is called the derivative of .    Note that the domain of the derivative function need not be the entire domain of : indeed, by definition it consists precisely of the points where is differentiable.

We will elaborate further on these equivalences when we discuss the rate of change interpretation of the derivative in more detail.    Failing to be differentiable  By definition, a function fails to be differentiable at an input if the limit does not exist. The precise reason for that failure to exist is reflected in the graph of , using the slope of tangent line interpretation of the derivative. Some examples and their graphical analogues:   Infinite limit vertical slope  If the limit is infinite at , then the tangent line to the curve at (if it exists) is vertical: , its slope is undefined.

In the latter case, the expression in question is understood to define a function, with the usual implied domain convention. Thus for example denotes the derivative of the constant function ; and denotes the derivative of the identity function .

The key here is to make explicit that is a power function using algebra: . Now it is a simple matter of applying the power function formula for the derivative: .

Note that the last two steps, strictly speaking, are unnecessary for this exercise, since no specific instructions were given regarding the form of the final answer. However, it is good to get in the habit of converting fluently between power and radical notation.

Apply the rate of change interpretation to the position, velocity, and acceleration functions of an object.      Rate of change  Recall that the key to understanding the rate of change interpretation of the derivative is to use the particular formulation , and to interpret the difference quotient as the average rate of change of between and . The idea is that as , the average rate of change computed as by gets closer and closer to an instantaneous rate of change of at . This is the motivation behind the definition of instantaneous rate of change given in .   Rate of change interpretations   Suppose quantity is modeled as a function of some other quantity . Roughly speaking, the derivative computes the (instantaneous) rate of change of with respect to . We elaborate below.   Difference quotient  Let and be particular values of quantity satisfying . The difference quotient computes the average rate of change of as the quantity varies from to : , . For each choice of , the difference quotient gives an approximation of the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to at .    Rate of change of with respect to  Let be a particular value of the quantity . The value of the derivative at is the (instantaneous) rate of change of with respect to at the particular input : ,         Height versus age   Suppose the height (in meters) of individuals in a population is modeled as a function of their age (in years).   Interpret the two statements below in terms of the height and age of people. Your interpretation should include units, and should address all numeric details in the statements. .    What does the following sequence of statements tell us about the relation of height versus age? Be specific. .         The statement asserts that the height of a 12-year old in the population is 1.5 meters.  The statement asserts that the rate of growth of a 12 year old in the population is meters per year.    The sequence of statements tells us that the rates of growth for 12-, 15-, and 18-year olds are, respectively, 0.06, 0.025, and 0.001 meters per year. This is consistent with the fact that as we grow older, our rate of growth slows, approaching a rate of zero around age 18.        Position, velocity, acceleration    Suppose an object moves along an oriented axis with origin . To simplify the units discussion, we assume below that distance is measured in meters (m) and time is measured in seconds (s).   Position  At any given time , the position  of the object is its directed distance (positive or negative) to the origin.    Displacement  Given times , the displacement of the object from time to time is the difference , often denoted as for short.    Velocity  At any given time the velocity  of the object is defined as rate of change of position with respect to time at . In other words, we have . Values of velocity can be positive or negative. We define the speed  of the object at time as     Acceleration  At any given time we define the acceleration  of the object as the rate of change of its velocity with respect to time at . In other words, .        Drone   Dudley gets his hands on the remote control for a drone and pilots it for a glorious 3 seconds. Luckily, the drone can only move directly up and down. The altitude (in meters) of the drone seconds after Dudley takes control is given as .   Derive formulas for the velocity , speed , and acceleration of the drone seconds after Dudley takes control.    Find the time intervals when the drone is ascending, and the time intervals when it is descending.    Describe the end of Dudley's flight at time seconds. Where is the drone? Did a fatal crash happen?    Compute (a) the displacement of the drone over the time interval , and (b) the total distance traveled.          We compute .    The drone ascending or descending is equivalent to the velocity being positive or negative. It will help here to factor our expression of : . From this we can easily sketch a graph of as follows:  Graph of velocity function   And from the graph of we see easily that is positive on and negative on . Thus the drone ascends for the first second, then descends for the remaining two seconds.    At time , the height of the drone is and the velocity is . This means that the downward velocity of the drone has slowed to 0 m per s upon impact. Dudley landed the drone safely, apparently!    The total displacement is given as . To compute the total distance traveled, we must separate the interval into the separate intervals where the drone ascends and descends. The basic principle here is that if movement is always in the same direction (up or down in our case) over a certain time interval, then displacement is equal to distance traveled.  Over the time interval the drone ascends from a height meters to a height of meters. Since the drone is always moving the same direction here, the total distance traveled over this time interval is meters.  Over the time interval the drone descends from a height of meters, to a height of meters. Again, since the drone is always moving in the same direction, the distance traveled over this time interval is 4 meters.  We conclude that in sum the drone has traveled a distance of meters.         Rates of change in economics  Derivative play a crucial role in economics, where this notion is often described in that field's particular jargon as some variety of marginal .   Marginal cost, revenue, profit   Suppose the cost (in dollars) of making a product is modeled as a function of the total quantity of the good produced. The marginal cost function is defined as . Thus computes the marginal cost (in dollars per unit producion) at a current level of production : this is the rate of change of cost with respect to quantity produced at the given production level .  We get notions of marginal revenue and marginal profit by replacing the cost function above with a revenue or profit function.     Marginals   Suppose the cost (in dollars) for a farmer to produce barrels of milk on a given day is given by . Suppose further that farmer can charge a price of when producing barrels of milk.   Determine the marginal cost of producing 100 barrels of milk, and give an easy to understand interpretation of what this means.    Determine the marginal profit of producing 100 barrels of milk.     Estimate the change in profit that would result in going from 100 barrels a day to 103 barrels of day.          By definition, marginal cost (with respect to barrels $b$ produced) is given as . In particular, we have . This tells us that as the farmer steps milk production from barrels, the cost increases at a rate of 128 dollars per barrel.    Let be the revenue earned when producing barrels of milk, under that assumption that all barrels will be purchased. We have . Lastly, since profit is is defined as revenue minus cost, we have and thus marginal profit is . The marginal profit at a production level of 100 barrels is thus . This tells us that increasing the production from 100 barrels results in the farmer's profit decreasing at a rate of 78 dollars per barrel. What's going on here is that although revenue will increase by increasing production, the rate at which it increases is less than the rate at which cost increases.     Assuming that the rate of change of profit is constant , equal to dollars per barrel, for production levels near 100 barrels, as we increase our production from 100 barrels, the profit decreases at a constant rate of 78 dollars per barrel. Thus we estimate that profit would decrease by dollars if we increase production from 100 to 103 barrels.  The reason this is an estimate and not necessarily the exact change in profit, is that our simplifying assumption need not be the case! That is, the rate of profit is not necessarily constant as a function of . Indeed, looking at the formula above, it most definitely is not in our case! And in fact, using our formula for we can compute exactly as .        "

Chain rule enhanced formulas  Using the chain rule in combination of our existing derivative formulas, leads to simple generalizations of these formulas where we replace the variable with an arbitrary differentiable function .

For example we have , and more generally . Similarly, for , we have .   We end this section with an application of the chain to a physical setting, where we investigate the rate of change of volume of an inflating balloon. Not surprisingly this depends both on the current radius of the balloon, and how fast that radius itself is expanding. The chain rule makes this observation much more precise! This is a first example of what is called a related rates problem. We will see more of these in .   Inflating a balloon   The volume (in cm ) of a spherical inflatable balloon is computed as , where is the radius of the balloon (in cm).   Compute the rate of change of the volume with respect to the radius .    Suppose now that while inflating the balloon, the radius is given by the function . Compute the rate of change of with respect to . Leave your answer in terms of and .          We have .    When is a function of time, the volume of the ballon is also a function of time: . Using the chain rule, we have . We thus see that at any given time , the rate of change with respect to is the product of the rate of change of volume with respect to for the radius value at ( , for ) and the rate of change of with respect to time at that time . (Of course this is just as the chain rule predicts: $\\frac{dV}{dt}=\\frac{dV}{dr}\\cdot \\frac{dr}{dt}$.) This makes general sense, physically. The rate of change of the radius is acting as a multiplier for the rate of change of the volume with respect to : in particular the greater the rate at which the radius increases, the greater the rate at which the volume increases.

Understand the role of the chain rule in the technique of implicit differentiation.    Use implicit differentiation to deduce geometric properties of graphs of equations.     We begin this section with some simple observations about curves in . Currently our main way of defining such a curve is as the graph of an equation. For example, let be the unit circle centered at the origin is defined as the graph of the equation . That is, is the set of all points satisfying . We call this an implicit description of the circle as its points are not given to us explicitly via some formula; rather, to produce actual points on it is up to us to find solutions to the equation ( , , ).   Graph of   Graph of unit circle     A similar way of defining a curve in is as the graph of a function . In other words, given a function , we define its graph to be the curve consisting of all points of the form , where . Note that this description gives an explicit formula for producing points on the curve: namely, given any in the domain, the point lies on the graph.   Graph of the function   Graph of function x squared     The graph of a function can also be understood as the graph of an equation : indeed, the set of points of the form are precisely the the set of solutions to the equation . In other words, all curves that are graphs of functions can also be thought of as graphs of equations. However, not all graphs of equations are graphs of functions! Indeed, our circle above is an example of a curve that is a graph of an equation, but not the graph of a function. How do I know? It fails the vertical line test!  Life is somewhat easier for us when a curve does happen to be given as the graph of a function. For example, in this scenario, we have a systematic way of determining what the tangent line to a given point is. That technique is not in general available to us for the circle , as that curve is not the graph of any function . So how can we answer questions about tangent lines to that curve.

  "body": " Related rates I  Any time two functions are related via an equation, we can deduce an equation involving those functions and their derivatives by taking the derivative of both sides. When doing empirical modeling, this simple observation allows us to take an established relationship between two quantities and deduce a relationship between the rates of change of these quantities. This type of argument is at the heart of so-called related rates problems. Our example with the inflatable balloon provides a particularly easy introduction to this method, as here one quantity (volume) can be expressed entirely in terms of the other: in other words, the starting relation here is just a formula.   Inflating a balloon (redux)   The volume (in cm ) of a spherical inflatable balloon is computed as , where is the radius of the balloon (in cm).  What is the rate of change at time , assuming that the volume at this point is and the rate of inflation at is cm per s?    Letting and be the volume and radius of the balloon after seconds, we have and hence . It follows that the rate of change of volume seconds after inflating is . We are told that . Thus it remains only to determine , the radius of the balloon at this time. We can derive this from the given fact that . Indeed, we have , or cm. We conclude that . That is, at time the volume is increasing at a rate of cm per second.    The next example is more involved as now the relationship between the relevant quantities is not directly given in terms of a formula.   Sliding ladder   A ladder of length 5 meters leans against a vertical wall; the base of the ladder lies 3 meters from the wall.

Define .   Functions and   Diagram of sliding ladder    We see easily from that . In terms of our introduced notation we have , and we wish to compute . Taking the derivative of both sides of , we have , and thus . It remains to compute . Evaluating at , we see that , and thus . We conclude that . In plain English, at the moment of the nudge the top of the ladder slides toward the ground at a rate of meters per second.     Related rates   The following steps are useful for modeling and solving a related rates problem.   Model the problem    Clearly define and name all important quantities in the problem.   Constant or static quantities should be assigned either a constant symbol or an explicit value.    Varying quantities should be modeled as functions of a common input quantity. Denote these quantities using function notation, taking care to define what the input variable is.    A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, often clarifies the role of different quantities in the problem.       Express the numeric information provided by the problem in terms of the function notation you introduced in Step 1a.    Identify what the problem is asking us to compute in terms of the function notation introduced in Step 1a. We are almost always interested in some rate of change , and this should be expressed as the derivative of one of the functions we defined, or a specific value of that derivative.    Establish an equation that relates the various functions we are interested in.   This should be an equation relating functions of some common variable. As such this equation will look like a function identity.    A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, will often help to derive this equation.         Do calculus    From the equation you established in Step 1d, derive a new equation that relates the derivative you are interested in with known values of functions and\/or derivatives of those functions. This usually amounts to computing the derivative of both sides of the original equation.    Use the new equation you derived in Step 2a to solve for the derivative function (or specific value thereof) you are interested in.      Summarize    Communicate the answer you derived in Step 2 in a plain English sentence that makes use of the language\/context of the stated problem.    Make sure that you do indeed answer the problem posed and include units details if applicable.          Sliding ladder: angle of inclination   Continuing with the setup as in , at what rate is the angle between the ladder and the ground changing at the moment when the base begins sliding?    We define .   Functions and   Sliding ladder diagram with angle    We wish to compute the rate of change of the angle with respect to time at the moment of the nudge. As illustrated by we have . Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to yields , and thus . We now compute , using the given fact that m\/s. It remains to compute . At time we have , as illustrated in .   Diagram at time   Sliding ladder diagram with angle initially    We conclude that . In plain English: at the moment of the nudge, the angle between the ladder and floor is decreasing at a rate of radians per second.     Stretched rubber sheet   A 20 m rectangular rubber sheet is placed in a stretching machine. Four seconds after the machine is turned on, the width of the rubber sheet is 10 meters and expanding at a rate of 0.25 m\/s. Is the height of the rubber sheet shrinking or expanding at this moment in time? How quickly is it shrinking or expanding. (Assume that during the shrinking process the area of the sheet remains constant and the sheet always maintains a rectangular shape.)    We define . In terms of our introduced notation, we have . We wish to compute , the rate of change of the height of the sheet with respect to time 4 seconds after the stretching begins. Since for all , taking the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to yields . Thus we have , and , where we have computed , using . In plain English: four seconds after the stretching begins, the height of the rubber sheet is decreasing at rate of meters per second.    "

Denote these quantities using function notation, taking care to define what the input variable is.    A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, often clarifies the role of different quantities in the problem.       Express the numeric information provided by the problem in terms of the function notation you introduced in Step 1a.    Identify what the problem is asking us to compute in terms of the function notation introduced in Step 1a. We are almost always interested in some rate of change , and this should be expressed as the derivative of one of the functions we defined, or a specific value of that derivative.    Establish an equation that relates the various functions we are interested in.   This should be an equation relating functions of some common variable. As such this equation will look like a function identity.    A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, will often help to derive this equation.         Do calculus    From the equation you established in Step 1d, derive a new equation that relates the derivative you are interested in with known values of functions and\/or derivatives of those functions. This usually amounts to computing the derivative of both sides of the original equation.    Use the new equation you derived in Step 2a to solve for the derivative function (or specific value thereof) you are interested in.      Summarize    Communicate the answer you derived in Step 2 in a plain English sentence that makes use of the language\/context of the stated problem.    Make sure that you do indeed answer the problem posed and include units details if applicable.        "

  "body": " Extreme value theorem     Use the derivative to investigate optimization questions.    Understand the extreme value theorem in the context of optimization.    Define absolute and local maximum and minimum values of a function on a given set .    Identify extreme values of a function graphically.    Introduce the notion of critical points as potential inputs where a function attains a local (or absolute) maximum or minimum.    Develop a procedure that determines the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed finite interval.     In our remaining lessons, we will frequently take up what are called optimization questions. Roughly speaking, these are questions related to the maximum and minimum values of a function on a given set. Optimization problems are naturally important in modeling situations: when modeling a quantity as a function of some other quantity , we naturally are interested in knowing whether it attains a maximal or minimal value, what that maximal or minimal value is (if it exists), and which inputs produces this value. The extreme value theorem represents a wonderfully straightforward answer to this first flavor of optimization problem: it tells us that if is continuous on the closed interval , then there is guaranteed to be both a maximal and minimal value. A shortcoming of this theorem is that it gives no indication of what exactly these maximum\/minimum values are (or how to find them)! We amend this situation in .  The statement of the extreme value theorem involves the notion of an absolute maximum\/minimum value of a function on a given set . Imagining this is intuitively clear to the reader, we launch straight into a discussion of the extreme value theorem. Afterward, we give precise definitions both for absolute and local maximum and minimum values. If you would like to see those definitions first, see .   Extreme value theorem   If is continuous on the closed interval , then there are inputs and for which is the absolute maximum value of on and is the absolute minimum value of on . In plain English: a continuous function always attains a maximum and minimum value over a closed interval .    The proof of this intuitive statement is just beyond our reach in terms of our current conceptual framework: we are missing only the notion of least upper bounds. In later math courses, like real analysis and topology, you develop an exceedingly important concept called compactness that allows you to eventually give a beautiful one-line proof of the extreme value theorem.    Although we do not give an actual proof the extreme value theorem, you can catch a glimmer of its truth by treating it graphically. Try the following: pick an interval in the -plane; pick endpoint values and for an arbitrary function and graph the corresponding points; now trace out the rest of the graph of your arbitrary , making it as wildly behaved as you like, but with the restriction that you pencil never leaves the paper ( is continuous) and the start and end values are and . You will see that now matter what function you end up sketching, it will always have reach a well-defined highest point (corresponding to the maximum value) and a well-defined lowest point (corresponding to the minimum value). The restriction that we cannot lift our pencil prevents our graph from going arbitrarily high (or low), or from getting arbitrarily close to a highest point but not actually hitting it.  Perhaps a more illustrative means of understanding the role of continuity in the extreme value theorem is to consider examples where this condition is removed.   Extreme values: discontinuous   The functions and graphed below illustrate how crucial continuity is to the extreme value theorem.   Extreme values and discontinuous functions    Graph of   Graph of f has a vertical asymptote      Graph of   Graph of g has a removable discontinuity       The function has infinite one-sided limits at , and as a consequence has neither a maximum nor a minimum value on the closed interval .  The function has values that get arbitrarily close to but not equal to , thanks to the removable discontinuity. As a result, has no maximum value on the interval: we have for all , and for any value less than , there is an input with .     Extreme values: open interval   As illustrated below, the function has no absolute maximum or minimum value on the open interval despite being continuous on this interval. This illustrates why the extreme value theorem insists that the finite interval in question must be closed .   Graph of   Graph of the tangent function        Extreme values   Assume is defined on the set , and let be an element of .    is an absolute maximum value of on if for all .     is an absolute minimum value of on if for all .     is a local maximum value of on if for all sufficiently close to .     is a local minimum value of on if for all sufficiently close to .     is an extreme value of on if it is an absolute or local maximum or minimum value of on .        Absolute max\/min implies local max\/min  Assume is defined on an interval . Observe that as pure logical consequence of the definitions, if is an absolute maximum or minimum value of on , then it is also a local maximum or minimum value of on . Indeed, if (resp. ) for all  , then the inequality certainly holds for all  sufficiently close to .    Local extreme values  In the phrase sufficiently close to is used as a convenient, but slightly less than rigorous shorthand. To be more precise in this definition we treat interior and endpoints of the set separately.  Given an interior point , we say that is a local maximum (resp., minimum) value of on if there is an open interval containing such that is an absolute maximum (resp., minimum) value on .  Similarly, if is a left (resp., right) endpoint of , then is a local maximum (resp., minimum) value of on if there is a half-open interval (resp., ) contained in such that is an absolute maximum (resp., minimum) value on .  In summary, for to be a local maximum or minimum value on means simply that there is some interval (or half-interval in the endpoint case) contained in on which is an absolute maximum or minimum value. Thus to identify graphically the local extreme values of a function , look for inputs such that when we restrict our gaze to the segment of the graph of lying over a small interval around , is seen to be an absolute maximum or minimum value.    Local and absolute extreme values   A graph of the function on the interval is graphed below.   Identify all and any inputs where has a local maximum or minimum value of on .    Decide whether has an absolute maximum value on , and whether has an absolute minimum value on .      Graph of   Graph of function with various local extrema          The function has a local maximum value at the left endpoint : indeed, we have for all (thus for all sufficiently close to ). The value at the right endpoint, somewhat surprisingly, is also a local max: for all we have .  Additionally, we see that is a local minimum value of , since for all . Finally, is easily seen to be the absolute maximum value of on . It follows from that is also a local minimum value of on     We have already observed that is the absolute maximum value of on . We claim that there is no absolute minimum value. To see why, first note that for all . Thus, if were an absolute minimum value of on we would have . However, since , for any , we can find an such that . It follows that has no absolute minimum value on .        Critical points and extreme values  Fermat   Assume is defined on and that is an interior point of . If is a local maximum or minimum value of on , and if is differentiable at , then .    We will show that if is a local maximum value of on and is differentiable at , then . The argument for the case where is a local minimum is exactly similar.  Firstly, since is assumed to be a local maximum value, we can find an interval containing such that for all .  Next, since is differentiable at , the limit exists, and we have . Observe further that using we have . Next, since for all sufficiently close to (more precisely, for all ), for all sufficiently close to . It follows that , and thus, taking limits, that . Since , we conclude that , as desired.    According to , points where either is not differentiable, or where are important to us, as these are candidates where the value is potentially a local maximum or minimum. Accordingly, we give such inputs a special name: critical points.   Critical point   Let be defined on . An element is a critical point of if either or is not differentiable at .    Let us now do some synthesis of the above theory. Assume is continuous on the closed interval .   According to there are inputs and in where attains its absolute maximum and minimum values, respectively.    In particular, and are local extreme values of the function.    According to , if and are interior points of , then they must be critical points of : , is either not differentiable at there, or is equal to zero there.    We conclude that the inputs and where attains its absolute extreme values are either one of the endpoints, or of the interval, or one of the critical points of in the interior of the interval.   Our synthesis gives rise to the following procedure for finding the absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval.   Extreme value theorem   Assume is continuous on the closed interval . To determine the absolute maximum and minimum values of on , proceed as follows.   Identify candidate inputs  The candidate inputs where potentially attains a maximum or minimum value consist of (i) the endpoints and of the interval along with the set of all critical points of lying in . We determine the latter by finding all solutions to the equation lying in , and identifying all elements of where is not differentiable.    Evaluate  Evaluate at all candidate inputs you found in Step 1.    Compare values  Compare the values of computed in Step 2. The maximum value in that set is the absolute maximum value of on ; the minimum value in that set is the minimum value of on .        Extreme values: factored polynomial   Let . Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of on the interval .    First compute . Note that is differentiable everywhere on the interval , so to find critical points we find all solutions to lying in . The key technique for solving this equation is factoring : . We now see that the last equality holds if and only if . These are thus our critical points. We now evaluate at these critical points, as well as at the endpoints of the interval: . Comparing these values, we conclude that is the absolute maximum value of on , and is the absolute minimum value of on .     Extreme values: rational function   Let . Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of on the interval .    First observe that since for all , the domain of is . Since is a rational function, it is continuous everywhere on its domain, hence continuous on .  Additionally, is easily seen to be differentiable everywhere with derivative . We now following . Since is differentiable everywhere, its critical points are the solutions to , which we now solve: . To complete the procedure, we evaluate at the candidate inputs : . We conclude that is the minimum value of on and is the maximum value of on . Below you find a graph of that bears out our analysis.   Graph of example function revealing the extreme values.       Distance between graphs   Let and . Find the maximum vertical distance between the graphs of and on the interval     The vertical distance point and on the two graphs is measured by . Thus we are interested in the extreme values of on the interval . For we have . Note that is not differentiable at , and thus this is one of our critical points. To find the others we solve: . We now evaluate at our three critical points, as well as the endpoints: . We conclude that on , or equivalently, . Thus the vertical maximal distance between the two graphs is and this occurs at the inputs . Below you find two diagrams that illustrate this result: the first depitcts the graphs of and separately, and the second is a graph of the difference function .

Do you notice anything interesting about the value of at ?          The function is increasing on its entire domain, with a horizontal asymptote of , meaning that . This means the quantity is always growing, approaches a ceiling value of , but never reaches that value.

We see that for the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at is positive, and gets more positive as increases. This means that is positive and increasing. In terms of , this means that is increasing at an increasing rate over this interval.    Similar reasoning shows that for the rate of change is positive but getting less positive ( , is decreasing). In terms of , this means that is increasing at a decreasing rate over this interval.

It turns out that for any logistic function the value of the function at this point in time is always equal to , half of the carrying capacity .  This property of logistic functions is useful for predicting the ceiling value of a quantity you are studying. Imagine you take daily measurements of a growing population of bacteria that you believe is accurately modeled by a logistic function. From that data you can compute the average rate of change over each day, which you interpret as an estimate of the instantaneous rate of change of growth each day.

For example, the function is not differentiable at , but the graph of still has a well-defined tangent line at the point : the issue is only that that tangent line is vertical. Our definition allows for to potentially be an inflection point. Indeed, we see that is an inflection point: is increasing for and decreasing for ; thus is concave up to the left of and concave down to the right of .  On the other hand, consider the function .

  "body": " Applied optimization     Model real world questions as an optimization problem about a function .    Use calculus techniques to fully analyze a modeled optimization problem and provide an answer in the form of a complete sentence.     In this section we apply our optimization techniques to real-world problems. Optimization problems occur in real life when we have a quantity that is given as a function as some other quantity , and whose value we wish to either maximize or minimize (or just optimize for short). As with the related rates problems we discussed in , the most challenging aspect of these applied optimization problems it to take the given scenario, described in plain English, and modeling it with mathematical functions that we can run through our optimization techniques. Let's begin with an example and then try and describe the general steps to solving one of these problems with a procedure.   Box of maximum volume   A square piece of cardboard of dimension meters is made into a box by cutting squares of equal dimension out of each corner and folding up the sides. (See .) Find the dimension of the cutout squares that maximizes the volume of the resulting box.   A box from a square   A square to a box       More detailed square-to-box diagram   More detailed square-to-box diagram    Let be the dimension of the cutout squares. The resulting box would have height , and width and length both equal to . Its volume would thus be . Since the cutout square dimension can range from to , we see that we wish to find the minimal value of on the interval . We have reduced the question to an extreme value theorem problem!  Following , we compute . From this factored form we see easily that the critical points of are and . Now evaluate at the endpoints of and the critical points: . We conclude that choosing the dimension of the cutout square to be meters results in a box of largest possible volume.     Applied optimization   The following steps are useful for modeling and solving a word problem involving optimization.   Model the problem     Make a detailed, labeled diagram summarizing the situation described.    Clearly define and name all important quantities in the problem.    Write down any important equations or formulas involving the quantities at play.    Identify the quantity that is to be optimized.   Look for language suggesting maximum or minimum values: , largest , most , greatest , smallest , least , .          Solve optimization problem     Express the quantity we wish to optimize as a function of exactly one variable.   If the quantity appears to be given as a function of more than one independent variable, look for a constraint equation that allows us to reduce to exactly one independent variable.    Make explicit what the domain of this function is, using the context of the problem.       Translate the given word problem as one of our types of optimization problems ( , EVT, find\/classify critical points, curve sketching, ) for the function .    Use an appropriate procedure ( , EVT procedure, find\/classify critical points, curve sketching, ) to solve the given optimization problem.   The domain of plays an important role in this step. In particular, pay attention to whether or not is a closed finite interval.          Summarize     Communicate the answer you derived in Step 2 in a plain English sentence that makes use of the language\/context of the stated problem.    Make sure that you do indeed answer the problem posed and include units details if applicable.           Minimal fence perimeter   Farmer Dudley is building a rectangular pen for his iguanas. He will use the 50 meter long side of his barn as one side of the pen, and will construct fencing for the remaining three sides of the pen. The pen must have a total area of 200 m . What is the minimum length of fencing Dudley must build to create an iguana pen matching these specifications.     Dudley's iguana pen   Dudley's iguana pen    Let and be the dimensions of the pen, where is the length of the barn that Dudley makes use of. Since the area of the pen must be 200 m , we see that and must satisfy . (This is often called a constraint equation.) The quantity that Dudley wishes to minimize is the length of fence he must build, which is . Our constraint equation implies that , and hence that . Lastly, the constraint equation implies that cannot be equal to zero; and since Dudley is using the barn side as one edge of his pen, we must have . Thus, we wish to find the minimal value of on the domain .  We first find the critical points of on this domain, since they are potential points where attains a local minimum value. We solve . Thus the only critical point of lying in is . The question now, is whether is the absolute minimum value of on . Note that we cannot apply to answer this question, since our domain is not a finite closed interval! Instead we look at the sign diagram of .   Sign diagram for derivative of f    From this sign diagram we conclude that is decreasing on the interval and increasing on the interval . It follows that must be the absolute minimum value of on , since for any other , we have . We conclude that minimal length of fencing Dudley can build to make his pen is meters.  We conclude with a graph of , the simple shape of which makes more tangible our logic above in arguing that attains its absolute minimum value at .   Graph of f      As we saw in the last example it is often the case that the domain of the function we wish to optimize is not of the simple form , where applies. In , we were optimizing a function on the interval , and had to rely on our wits a bit to convince ourselves that we have found an absolute extreme value. The following generalization of the extreme value theorem gives a more systematic procedure for finding absolute extreme values in such situations.   Generalized extreme value theorem   Let be an interval of any sort ( , can be open, closed, or neither, and can be finite or infinite), and let and be the (possibly infinite) left and right endpoints of . Assume is continuous on . To investigate whether attains a maximum or minimum value on , proceed as follows.   Identify candidate inputs  The candidate inputs where potentially attains a local maximum or minimum value consist of the (i) any finite endpoints of that are elements of , and (ii) any critical points of lying in .    Evaluate  Evaluate at all candidates you found in Step 1. Let be the minimum of these values, and let be the maximum of these values.    Evaluate endpoint limits  Evaluate the two endpoint limits and . (In the case where the given endpoint is infinite, the one-sided limit is understood simply as the corresponding limit at infinity.)    Compare , , and endpoint limits  Assume that each limit in Step 3 either exists or is infinite.   If neither of the endpoint limits from Step 3 is less than or equal to , then is the absolute minimum value of on . Otherwise, there is no absolute minimum value.    If neither of the endpoint limits from Step 3 is greater than or equal to , then is the absolute maximum value of on . Otherwise, there is no absolute maximum value.           Minimal fence perimeter (reprise)   Let's use to complete the last steps of our argument in . We were trying to find the absolute minimum value of on the half-open interval , and had determined that was the sole critical point of . instructs us to evaluate at and , and compute the limit at : . We conclude that is the absolute minimum value of on (and that has no absolute maximum value).     Closest point on parabola   Find the on the parabola whose distance to is the smallest possible. The distance between two points and in is defined as .     Distance between and points on parabola   Diagram of point P and parabola     The distance from to an arbitrary point on is given by . Since the -coordinate of can be any real number, we wish to find the minimum value of on . We follow .  Since is differentiable everywhere, its critical points are solutions to . We solve: , where the last step follows from the fact that a quotient is equal to zero precisely when its numerator is equal to zero.  Let . In general it is not so easy to find roots of a cubic polynomial. However, recall the fact that if has an integer root, it must be a divisor of . Trying a few divisors ( ), we easily see that , and hence that is a factor of , Using polynomial long division, we see that Furthermore, using the quadratic formula, we see that the has no real roots. Thus the root of (and only critical point of ) is .  According to , to investigate extreme values of on we should evaluate at and compute the limits of at : , where the limit at infinity computations follow from the fact that as .  We conclude that is the absolute minimum value of , and thus that is the point on closest to .     Snowy campus walk   Dudley stands at the southeast corner of a 1 km square field on campus that is currently covered in snow. He is hurrying to get to his calculus course taking place in the mathematics building at the northwest corner of the field. Dudley plans on first walking (at constant speed) along some portion of the ploughed east-west path that runs along the southern border of the field, and then cutting across the snowy field to head directly toward the mathematics building (at constant speed). Because of the snowy conditions, Dudley can move twice as fast on the ploughed path than he can when walking across the field. If Dudley wants to get to the mathematics building as quickly as possible, how far along the ploughed path should he walk before cutting across the field?     Dudley's snowy walk   Dudley's snowy walk    Let be the distance Dudley walks along the east-west ploughed path, in which he walks a distance of through the snowy field. Let be the constant speed at which Dudley can walk through the snowy field; it follows that he moves at maximum speed along the ploughed path. Using the (distance)=(rate) (time) formula for objects traveling at constant speed, we see that the total time it takes for Dudley to get to the math building taking such a path is . We wish to find the minimum value of on the interval . We follow . Since is differentiable everywhere, its critical points are the solutions to . We solve (treating as a constant): . Thus the only critical point of in is . After evaluating at the critical point and the endpoints and doing some careful algebra, we see that . Although not totally obvious, you can show by hand that from whence it follows that is the minimal value of on . Thus Dudley should travel a distance of km along the ploughed path before heading across the snowy field. Godspeed, Dudley!     Optimizing revenue   The starting price of a certain model of television is $450. At this price point there are 1000 weekly sales of the television. A marketing team discovers that for each discount of $10 applied to the TV price, the number of weekly sales increases by 100 per week. How should the company price the television in order to maximize weekly revenue?    Let be the number of ten-dollar discounts applied to the starting price. According to our marketers, the number of weekly sales if applying ten-dollar discounts to the price is . Thus as a function of , our weekly revenue is . We wish to maximize the function for . (We have as we do not want the price of the television to be negative!)  We apply . We first compute . It follows that the only critical point of in is . Now evaluate at the endpoints and the critical point: Thus revenue is maximized when offering ten-dollar discounts to the price of the televion. In other words, the television should be offered at a price of dollars.    "

Find the formula for an exponential function given two points on the graph of the function.    Understand how the values of the coefficient and base of an exponential function affect the shape of the graph.      Motivating exponential functions  When deciding how to model a quantity as a function of of some other quantity , our choice of function is governed by how the output quantity changes as the input quantity changes. Recall that the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific input is given by the derivative ; and that the derivative can be estimated by computing average rates of change over small intervals about .  We can distinguish between different types of functions by examining their rate of change at different inputs. For example, the rate of change of a constant functions is zero everywhere, reflecting the fact that the output value of a constant function never changes! Similarly, a linear function has constant rate of change , and a quadratic function has a linear rate of change function .  In this section we will define and start to explore exponential functions. These functions exhibit a fundamentally different kind of rate of change behavior that also happens to be ubiquitous in real-world empirical phenomena, making them exceptionally useful for modeling purposes.   Motivating example: percent rate of change   Suppose that a credit card company is offering a annual interest rate on a one-time loan. If you take out a loan for and don't make any payments, after one year you still owe the original , plus 10% of , so your balance after a year is: . If we instead borrowed , after 1 year we again owe the original , but now we also owe 10% of , and thus the balance after a year is: . If we were to borrow dollars, we reason the same way that after a year the balance on the loan is   If we go another year without paying anything toward the loan, we repeat our calculations for a second year. Let's diagram out what happens over two years if we borrow dollars initially.    Start  After first year  After second year       If we started by borrowing , the sequence of debts would be as described below.    Start  After first year  After second year       Using the same reasoning, if we borrow dollars without paying anything back, the sequence of debts over two years follows the same pattern.    Start  After first year  After second year       What will happen after 3 years? Adding to the loan balance of after two years, the original loan will have grown to .  Here we see a new kind of pattern developing: annual growth of is leading to powers of the base , where the power to which we raise corresponds to the number of years the loan has grown. Note that the change occurs in the exponent of the formula: where is the number of years since we took out the loan. Each additional year results in an additional multiplication by , so for each year that passes, the power of the base will increase by . This type of change is an example of exponential growth .      Defining Exponential Functions  The pattern described by the example above is new to us. We have yet to see a function where the variable is in the exponent. It turns out that such functions are not algebraic , although proving this to be the case is not straightforward. We call a function transcendental if it is not algebraic. In this course we will eventually introduce four different types of transcendental functions: exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. We begin with exponential functions, which we will now endeavor to define as best we can. Exponential functions look similar to power functions, but with the roles of constant and variable reversed in the base and exponent.   Exponential Functions   An exponential function is a function that can be written in the form for some real numbers and such that , and .     Power functions versus exponential functions  It is easy to conflate a power functions with an exponential function , since both are defined using the power operation. The key difference between the two types of functions is the precise position of the input variable :   in a power function , the input variable appears as the base of the power expression;    in an exponential function , the input variable appears as the exponent of the power expression. Hence the name.       Domain of exponential function  As defined, the domain of an exponential function is , the set of all real numbers. The conscientious reader may object, however, that when defining power expressions like , we only did so for rational exponents of the form , where and are integers. For example, we have given no definition of the power expression . To that conscientious reader we say: you are absolutely justified! Of course there is a perfectly rigorous way to define for all (not just rational ), but for now you will just have to take this on faith. For the time being, we are more focused on detailing the important properties of exponetial functions so that you can make use of them in modeling situations.   Since exponential functions involve a power expression of the form , you in order to facilitate working with them, you may want to review the various rules governing power expressions articulated in . The next example illustrates how these can be put to use.   Standard form of exponential functions   Each function below is exponential. Write it in the standard form .                                  We have .    We have .    We have .    We have .    We have .         Growth of exponential Functions  Let's look at another practical application of exponential functions in order to better understand their properties:    Suppose that at age 25 you receive a signing bonus of $20,000 at your new job Congratulations! and you can choose between one of two ways to use the money: you can invest it in a mutual fund that will, on average, earn 8% interest annually, or you can purchase a used car that will, on average, depreciate 12% annually. Let's explore how the $20,000 changes over time.  Let denote the value of the $20,000 after years if it is invested in the mutual fund. Let denote the value of the car years after it is purchased.  We know that since when , you are starting with $20,000. After one year you will have 8% more, so that .  In general, a quantity increasing by 8% annually will be multiplied by 1.08 each year, so that .  A formula for after years is then . A graph of is   describes 8% annual growth over years.    Let's now look at the value of the car. We know that . After one year, the value of the car will be 12% less than it was originally worth, so that .  Note that if a quantity depreciates (meaning decreases by) 12% annually, after a given year, of that quantity remains. So for each year that passes, we multiply by another : .  A formula for after years is then . A graph of is   describes 12% annual depreciation over years.      Note the very different behavior of the two functions: 8% growth results in an increasing, concave up function, while 12% depreciation results in a decreasing, concave up function. Both functions have a coefficient of . The only difference in the formula is in the base of the exponential function: growth corresponds to a base of , while depreciation corresponds to a base of . This is not a coincidence. Bases larger than 1 will increase as the exponent increases, while bases between 0 and 1 will decrease as the exponent increases.  For an exponential function , we note that , so an exponential function has -intercept equal to the coefficient . This is sometimes called the initial value of the quantity being modeled. In the example above, and are the initial quantity of your bonus that you either invested or paid for the car.  Note that because a positive number raised to any power is always positive (for instance, and ), the expression is also always positive. An exponential function will then always be positive when the coefficient is positive and will always be negative when is negative. In particular, is never zero, and thus has no -intercepts. In the example above, and both have positive coefficient , so these two quantities will always be positive for any value of . This makes sense intuitively in both examples: the values of the mutual fund and car cannot be negative.  Again looking at Example , we call the \"growth factor\" of and similarly the growth factor of because we are multiplying by that factor for each 1-unit increase in time. In addition, we note that these values stem from the actual growth rates: for , so that the growth factor is , and for , so that the growth factor is , the latter growth rate being negative because value is deprecating. In general, for a function of the form , we call the growth factor . Moreover, if , we call the growth rate . Whenever , we often say that the function is exhibiting exponential growth , whereas if , we say exhibits exponential decay .    In your own words, explain the difference between growth factor and growth rate. Use the context of Example to help you explain.    Let's compare linear and exponential functions to best illustrate this new growth pattern.   Growth patters: linear versus exponential Functions   In the tables below, we see output for two different functions and that correspond to equally spaced inputs:    Table of values for     0  3  6  9            12  10  8  6      Table of values for     0  3  6  9            12  9  6.75  5.0625      In the left-hand table, we see a function that exhibits constant average rate of change since the change in output is always for any change in input of . Said differently, is a linear function with slope . Since its -intercept is , the function's formula is .  The difference between one output and the next is always a constant , as long as the input increases by 3.  By contrast, the function given by the right-hand table does not exhibit constant average rate of change: .  Thus the difference between one output and the next is not constant as the input increases by a constant amount and is not a linear function.  Instead, observe that in the table for , each output is a multiple of the previous output . The first two outputs have a ratio of . The second and third outputs have a ratio of   The third and fourth outputs have a ratio of . For , we see that when the input increases by 3, the output is multiplied by . As a formula,     Summarizing the key difference between linear and exponential change:  \\fbox{ Whereas the differences in the outputs of a linear function are constant, the ratios in the outputs of the exponential function are constant (over equally spaced inputs). }    In Example , the exponent of is . Why does this translate to multiplying by when increases by ? What would happen if we used as the exponent instead?      Finding Formulas for Exponential Functions  We now do some algebra. Recall that we can find the formula of a linear function from knowing only two points that lie on the line. Similarly, if we know two points on the graph of an exponential function, we can determine the function's formula. We demonstrate two different methods for doing so in the next example and the following exercise.    Suppose that is an exponential function and we know that and . Determine the exact values of and for which .    Since we know that , the two data points give us two equations in the unknowns and . First, using , , and using we also have .  Because we know that the ratios of outputs of an exponential function corresponding to equally-spaced inputs must be constant, we consider the ratio of our outputs : .  Solving for , we find that .  Using the exact value and substituting this value for in , we see that   Therefore, and a plot of confirms that the function indeed passes through and :      Another Approach   In Example , we saw that as the input increases by , the ratio of the outputs is . Since the ratio of outputs is constant for exponential functions, another increase of in will result in multiplication by another , so that   From here, use the fact that (or ; you can use either) to find . Verify that this value of is the same as was found in Example . (You will probably want to write what you found as a decimal.)  Lastly, observe that: so that the base of the two functions is the same if we isolate in the exponent.      Properties of Exponential Functions  We've seen in our examples so far that exponential function arise when modeling quantities that change by a percent of their value. In this section, we will explore how this affects the shape of such functions.   Exponential functions: graphical properties   Use the Desmos interactive in to answer the following questions.   The Desmos graph is initially set to and . Describe the shape of the resulting function . Is the function positive? Negative? Increasing? Decreasing? Concave up? Concave down?    Experiment setting to any nonzero number (try both positive and negative) and setting to either a number between 0 and 1, or a number greater than 1. How do these different choices affect the shape of the graph?    Why can't we use ? Set in the Desmos graph. How does this change the shape of the graph? Would you call this graph \"exponential?\"    Why can't we have ? Set to any nonzero number and . How does this change the shape of the graph? Would you call this graph \"exponential?\"    Set . It's going to look very strange (if Desmos shows you anything; sometimes it doesn't). Think about what values we can have for the exponent in the expression . What would happen with ? ? ? There are infinitely many values of for which a negative base would result in an undefined expression. This is why the definition of an exponential function excludes .      Desmos interactive : graphs of exponential functions      If we consider an exponential function with a growth factor , such as the function pictured to the left below, then the function is always increasing because higher powers of are greater than lesser powers (for example, ). On the other hand, if , such as the function pictured to the right below, then the exponential function will be decreasing because higher powers of positive numbers less than 1 get smaller (for example, ). If you don't believe this, plug the numbers into a calculator.   Graph of    ,   Exponential growth function      ,   Exponential decay function        We also notice that each graph bends upward and is therefore concave up. We can better understand why this is so by considering the average rate of change of both and on consecutive intervals of width 1, so that the average rate of change can be computed by . The tables below give the average rate of change of and on several consecutive unit intervals:    Average rate of change of     Average rate of change of     The exponential function in is seen to have an average rate of change that is positive and increasing. This suggests that is increasing at an increasing rate . As a result, the graph of is concave up.  Similarly, the exponential function in is seen to have an average rate of change that is negative but increasing (getting less negative). This suggests that is decreasing at a decreasing rate . As a result, the graph of is also concave up.  We summarize these properties in the theorem below.   Properties of exponential functions   Let and be positive real numbers, and let be the exponential function .   The domain of is .  The range of is . In particular, for all .    We have ; , the -intercept of the graph of is .    If , then is increasing and concave up on its entire domain.    If , then is decreasing and concave up on its entire domain.       Since we did not even give a complete definition of the exponential function , we are certainly in no position to prove most of these assertions. Later we will provide derivative formulas that will allow us to derive these. However, those derivative formulas will themselves be given without formal proof. As we intimated in , much of what we present in this course about exponential functions must be taken on faith. But keep in mind that this state of affairs is a consequence of a pedagogical choice, and not a deficiency in the mathematical theory!    As a consequence of the properties of , it is relatively simple to produce a convincing sketch of an exponential function.   Graphing exponential functions      Produce a detailed graph of the function by computing a table of values including inputs .    Produce a graph of by transforming the graph of appropriately using shifting and scaling techniques.          Note first that according to , since the base of lies between 0 and , the graph of will be decreasing and concave up on its entire domain. The table of values below, along with the corresponding plotted points, will bear this out.   Values of            Plotting these points and extrapolating to a smooth curve, we obtain the graph below.   Graph of exponential function      The graph of is obtained from that of by first multiplying the -coordinates of the points of by , and then adding to them: that is, by reflecting across the -axis, scaling vertically by , and then shifting up by . The resulting graph is shown below.   Graph of transformed exponential function             Suppose .

(b) According to your formula, how much will a movie ticket cost in years?             SOLUTION (a) We assume that the price of a movie ticket increases at the rate of 3.7% per year.

Towns 2, 3, 6 are growing and towns 1, 5, 4 are shrinking. Town 6 is growing the fastest since its growth factor of 1.187 is the largest. Since 1.187 - 1 = 0.187, it is growing at a rate of 18.7%. Town 5 is shrinking the fastest since its decay factor of 0.74 is the smallest. Since 1 - 0.74 = 0.26, it is shrinking at a rate of 26%.

Draw conclusions about the range of exponential functions using the intermediate value theorem.    Produce accurate graphs of functions involving exponential expressions.      Limit properties  Having introduced the basic definitions and properties of exponential functions, we now introduce some proper calculus notions into our analysis, starting with continuity. As with algebraic functions, it turns out that exponential functions are continuous everywhere on their domains. Although we are not in a position to give a formal proof of this fact, continuity of these functions is plainly evident from the graphs we have examined so far, which have no breaks or holes.   Continuity of exponential functions   Let be a positive real number. The exponential function is continuous for all . As a result, we have for all .     Exponential limit   Compute . Your answer should be expressed as a rational number. Justify your reasoning.    First observe that since the function is the result of combining various continuous functions using multiplication, addition and composition, it is itself continuous on all of , and thus satisfies for any . Thus .    Continuing with our limit analysis, we next examine the end behavior of an exponential function : that is, we wish to compute .  To start, let's consider the two basic exponential functions and and their respective values at , and .   Table of values for and               For the increasing function , we see that the output of the function gets very large very quickly. In addition, there is no upper bound to how large the function can be. Indeed, we can make the value of as large as we'd like by taking sufficiently big. We thus say that as increases,  increases without bound and conclude For the decreasing function , we see that the output is always positive but getting closer and closer to 0. Indeed, because we can make as large as we like, it follows that we can make its reciprocal as small as we'd like. We thus say that as increases,  approaches 0 : , . What about the limits of these functions at ? It turns out these limits are essentially equal to the reciprocal of the limits at , thanks to the exponential property . Assuming our results from above, we have . Our analysis above, examining the special cases and generalizes easily to arbitrary positive bases . The crucial feature of is whether it is greater than or less than as the following theorem articulates.   End behavior of exponential functions   Let , where is a positive real number.

Exponential functions are continuous on their domain ;    One limit at infinity of an exponential function is , and the other is .   From these two facts, we can deduce a third important fact about the range of an exponential theorem, using our old friend, the intermediate value theorem : namely, for any exponential function .  Let's see why. Assume with . (The case is exactly similar.) Given any positive , since , we can find a positive such that ; similarly, since we can find a negative such that . We thus have , continuous on (since is continuous everywhere), and . We conclude that there exists some such that . The argument shows that for any positive , we have . Since furthermore , we conclude that .

Let's look at how this sequence of transformations affects the graph:   Scale by  Consider the first transformation, from to .

Understand inverse functions as a reversing or undoing operation.    Compute formulas for inverse functions.    Determine the graph of an inverse function from the graph of the original function.      One-to-one functions  We saw in that exponential growth functions are increasing on their entire domain, and that exponential decay functions are decreasing. As a result, an exponential function satisfies an important property: given two distinct inputs and ( , ), we the outputs and are distinct ( , ). Why is this true? Take the case where is an exponential growth function, so that in particular it is increasing on its domain. If , then one of the two inputs is greater than the other. Without loss of generality, we may assume . But then since is increasing, we have , which implies .  A function that satisfies this property of sending distinct inputs to distinct outputs is called one-to-one , as we now make official.   One-to-one function   A function is one-to-one on its domain if for all with . Using logical shorthand: , or equivalently, using the contrapositive, . Given a subset , we say that is one-to-one on if the implication holds for all .    Before proceeding in our investigation of one-to-one functions, we hasten to point out that not all functions satisfy this property, as the next example illustrates.   One-to-one functions   Use algebraic methods to determine whether the function with given domain is one-to-one.    ,      ,      ,           The function is one-to-one on its domain . We have for all .    The function is not one-to-one on its domain , since , and yet .    The function with domain , by contrast, is one-to-one! To see why we examine more carefully what it means for for arbitrary elements . We have . Thus if and only if . It follows that given distinct elements , we cannot have , because we cannot have .        Importance of domain  As the previous illustrates, the role of the domain of a function is essential in determining whether the function is one-to-one or not. As we saw there, the function with domain is not one-to-one ( , , but it is one-to-one on the subset .   As the next example illustrates, knowing that a function is one-to-one allows us to solve certain equations more easily.   Algebra with one-to-one functions   Find all satisfying     To use properties of one-to-one functions, we first observe that the equation can be expressed as where . Since is exponential, we know it is one-to-one on its domain . Thus we have . Thus the solutions to the equation are and .    In we used algebra to decide whether a given function was one-to-one. The horizontal line test provides a convenient graphical method for doing the same. The simple principle of this test can be summarized as follows.   If is not one-to-one, then we can find two distinct inputs and whose outputs are equal: , .    Graphically, this means that the points and on the graph of are distinct (they have different -coordinates), but have the same -coordinate .    As a result, the horizontal line intersects the graph of in at least two distinct points.    Conversely, if some horizontal line intersects the graph of in at least two distinct points and , then we must have , showing that is not one-to-one.      Horizontal line test   Let be the graph of a function .  If for all , the horizontal line intersects in at most one point, then is one-to-one.  Conversely, if there is horizontal line that intersects at more than one point, then is not one-to-one.     Horizontal versus vertical line test  The horizontal line test probably reminds you of another line test introduced long ago in this course: namely, the vertical line test ( ). Make sure you do not conflate the two! Recall that the vertical line test is used to determine whether a given curve in the plane was in fact the graph of a function. By contrast, when using the horizontal line test, we know already that the curve is the graph of a function , and wish to ascertain whether that function is one-to-one or not.    Horizontal line test  Similarly to the vertical line test, it might be useful to envision the horizontal line test as a scanning procedure. Imagine scanning your graph with a device that produces a green horizontal line that we move up and down across the entire plane.   If at some moment during the scan our horizontal line hits two or more points, then our scanner emits a loud error beep, indicating that has failed the horizontal line test, and is thus is not one-to-one.    If, on the other hand, we are able to scan the entire vertical range of without hearing the error beep, then has passed the horizontal line test, and thus is one-to-one.      Let's see how this scanning analogy works when applying the horiztonal line test to . As illustrated in , for lines with , our scanner emits no error beep, since such lines intersect the graph of in at most one point. However, as soon as our scanner line moves above the -axis, it starts emitting error beeps, as each such line intersects the graph of in two points. We conclude that is not one-to-one, just as we did in .   Applying horizontal line test to   Visualization of horizontal line test applied to squaring function     Returning to our discussion about exponential functions at the beginning of this section, we observe that we were able to deduct the one-to-one property from another property of exponential functions: namely, their monotonicity. To repeat that argument, if is increasing (or decreasing) on a subset of its domain, then clearly it is one-to-one on that set: in the increasing case, values of increase as the input values increase, thus distinct inputs have distinct outputs; similarly, in the decreasing case, values of decrease as the input values increase, thus again distinct inputs have distinct outputs. We have thus established the following theorem.   Monotonic functions are one-to-one   If is monotonic on a subset of its domain , then is one-to-one on .     One-to-one versus monotonic  It is important to observe that being one-to-one is not in general equivalent to being monotonic. However, in the special case where the function is continuous and the relevant set is an interval , then the two conditions are in fact equivalent. Since we deal almost exclusively with continuous functions, you will find that showing a function is monotonic is often the most convenient way to show it is one-to-one.  As an exercise, come up with a noncontinuous function that is one-to-one on its domain , but not monotonic. Hint: as always, a piecewise defined function usually is a good place to start!    Monotonic functions are one-to-one   Show that the given function is one-to-one on its domain using a monotonicity argument.   Linear function   , ,     Integer power function   , an odd positive integer, .    -th root function   , an odd positive integer, .          As we have seen before, linear functions with nonzero slope are monotonic. Indeed, in the case given we have which is either always positive (if ) or always negative (if ). We conclude that is either increasing or decreasing on its entire domain, and thus one-to-one by .    We might just as well use the vertical line test here, recalling what graphs of power functions look like when is an odd positive integer. (See .) However, we use a monotonicity argument instead by way of illustration. We have . Since is odd, is even , which means that for all . As a result is increasing on the intervals and . Since furthermore is strictly negative on , is zero at , and is strictly positive on , we conclude that is increasing on .    The argument here is similar to the one above. We have . Since and are both negative for and both positive for , we see that for all . (Note that is not defined at .) As above we conclude that is increasing on the intervals and , and since is strictly negative on , is zero at , and is strictly positive on , we conclude that is increasing on .         Invertible functions  As we will see, the one-to-one property is closely related to another important function property: invertibility .   Invertible function   A function is invertible if there is a function satisfying the following properties: . The function in this case is called the inverse function of , and we write .     Inverse function notation  Unfortunately, we use the same superscript notation for an inverse of a function that we use for the reciprocal of a number . It is extremely important that you do not conflate these two operations! In particular, the inverse of a function is not the same thing as its reciprocal function: that is, !! As a simple counterexample, consider the function . You can easily verify for yourself that the function satisfies , and is thus the inverse function of . But clearly in this case since for all .    Inverse as a reverse function  Suppose is invertible with inverse . It is instructive to think of the defining equations and as saying that the function  undoes whatever does to an input , and conversely that  undoes whatever does to an input .  In more detail, think of as an operation that takes inputs and transforms them into the element . Similarly, think of as another process that takes inputs and transforms them into the element . The identity , can then be understood as saying that if we first apply the process , yielding , and then apply the process to this result, yielding , we get back our original input . In other words, the process  reverses (or undoes ) the process . And conversely, the process reverses (or undoes) the process . gives a schematic representation of this idea of a process and its reverse.   Conceiving inverse functions as a reversing process   Diagram illustrating idea of inverse as a reversing process      According to , to show that a given function is invertible, we must prove that an inverse function exists. If the starting function is simple enough, we are often able to find a formula for an inverse function via algebra, as the next example illustrates.   Computing inverses   For the given function , show that is invertible by providing an explicit inverse function .    ,      , ,      ,           For a function to satisfy the inverse equations given any output , we need . We can determine the formula for by starting with the equation , which expresses in terms of , and solving it for in terms of : . Thus our inverse function should be defined as for all . Observe that is just the name of a variable here, so we are free now to replace it with the more standard variable name , and write .  Let's verify that is indeed the inverse function of . We have and , as desired.    Reasoning exactly as above, doing the same algebra with the undetermined constants and , we find that . Interestingly, we have shown that (a) all non-constant linear functions are invertible, and (b) the inverse of a linear function is again a linear function!    We use the same algebraic technique as in (a). That is, we start with the equation and try to solve for in terms of . The resulting expression in yields a formula for . Here goes: . Thus we have . If you prefer, we can replace the variable name with and write . Again, for the sake of illustration, it is worthwhile that our function does indeed satisfy the inverse equations and . We have and , as desired.       Let's formalize the technique we employed in for computing formulas for inverse functions (when they exist).   Computing inverse function formula   Let be an invertible function. To algebraically derive a formula for proceed as follows.   Start with the equation , where the right side is the formula for . The equation thus expresses an output in terms of the input .    Algebraically solve the starting equation for in terms of , yielding an equation of the form , where is an mathematical expression solely in terms of the variable .    The inverse function then has formula .       As hinted at above, when the starting invertible function is complicated enough, the algebra that goes into is often too complicated for us to successfully find an explicit formula for the inverse function . Accordingly, it pays to have some alternative methods for determining whether a given function is invertible. The next theorem does exactly this by linking invertibility to the one-to-one property.   Invertibility equivalence   Let be a function.   If is invertible, then is one-to-one.    If is one-to-one, then letting , the function is invertible.     is invertible if and only if is one-to-one and .          Assume is invertible, and let be its inverse. We have , showing that is one-to-one.    Assume is one-to-one. By definition of , for every there is some , such that . Since furthermore is one-to-one, there is in fact exactly one such that . Thus we can define a function as follows: given , where is the unique element of satisfying . It is now straightforward to verify that satisfies the inverse equations and .  It is worthwhile observing where the one-to-one property comes into play in this argument. If we didn't know that was one-to-one, then there would be no guarantee that for each there was one and only one satisfying : there could be two such elements, or even more! In that case, our proposed definition of as the element of satisfying would not be well defined.    This follows immediately from (1) and (2).       Connecting invertibility with the one-to-one property allows us to show a given function is invertible without necessarily having to find an explicit inverse function. For example, each of the functions in can be shown to be invertible simply by showing that they are monotonic, and hence one-to-one.  Of equal importance is the fact that gives us alternative means for showing that a function is not invertible. If we only had the definition of invertibility at your disposal, to do this we would have to prove somehow that no inverse function exists. That can be quite an onerous task, when you consider the fact that there are infinitely many functions out there that could serve as . By contrast, using xref=\"th_inv_equivalence\"\/>, we can show that is not invertible simply by showing that (a) is not one-to-one, or (b) .   Invertibility   Determine whether the given function is invertible.    ,      ,      ,      ,           We will show separately that is one-to-one and . It follows from that is invertible.  We have . Since , we see that , and hence that is increasing on . It follows that is one-to-one.  Since and , and since is continuous, it follows that . Indeed, given any , the limit statements imply that there are numbers with satisfying . By the intermediate value theorem, there is an element satisfying , as desired.    The function is not one-to-one, since . Thus it is not invertible.    Although the function is one-to-one (see ), it is not invertible since is not equal to the given codomain .    The function is one-to-one and satisfies . Thus is invertible. Indeed, it is easy to see that its inverse function is .        Invertibility equivalence  The function is a good example of a function that we are able to show is invertible using , but for which it is very difficult to find an explicit formula for the inverse function . Indeed, in order to solve the equation for in terms of , we would need some sort of cubic analogue of the quadratic formula. As it turns out, there is such a formula, called Cardano's formula , but it is complicated enough that you in all likelihood have never seen it before. Indeed, even making sense of how to use Cardano's formula requires knoweledge of the complex numbers!    Invertibility from tables   From the given table of values determine whether the function is invertible or else explain why we cannot say for sure.    Table of values for    x  -1 0 1 2    f(x)  3 -5 1 -5        Table of values for    x  -1 0 1 2    f(x)  2 1 0 -1        Table of values for    x  -1 0 1 2    f(x)  2 1 0 -1             The given function is not one-to-one, since . Thus it is not invertible.    Note that by definition the given function has domain and codomain . It is easily verified from the table that is one-to-one and that furthermore . Thus is invertible.    In this case we cannot say for sure whether is invertible or not. The information from the given table only tells us that is one-to-one on the subset of its domain ; it is still possible that is not one-to-one on all of . Additionally, the information from the table does not permit us to determine whether . Indeed, it only tells us that .         Relating functions and their inverses  Not surprisingly, if is an invertible function, then there are many close connections between properties of and properties of its inverse function , starting with the fact that . The next theorem compiles a bunch of these similarities for your convenience. A guiding principle here is that we move back and forth between information about and information about by reversing the roles of inputs and outputs. This is most transparently seen in statement (3) below. Statement (4) is seen to be a direct consequence of (3) once you know that reflecting a point through the line yields the point , which is not entirely obvious.   Inverse function compendium   Let be an invertible function.   We have and for all and .    We have .    The point is on the graph of if and only if the point is on the graph of .    The graph of is the reflection of the graph of through the line .        Inverse of exponential function   Let be defined as .   Explain why is invertible.    Determine and     Compute a table of values for including the inputs .    Compute a table of values of from the table of values for .    Use your table of values to plot the graphs of and on the same coordinate system.          The function is increasing on its domain, and hence one-to-one. Furthermore, we saw in the previous section that . Thus is invertible by .    We have . These properties are nicely illustrated in the graph of and given in .    The function has the following table of values:   Table of values for                            To obtain a table of values for we simply reverse the roles of input and output. Equivalently, we simply swap the order of the entries in all rows below the header.   Table of values for                            We now use the tables for and to plot graphs for both functions. You find the result in . Our diagram includes the line . Observe that the two graphs are indeed reflections of one another through this line, as predicted by .
