  "title": "How to Read Mathematics",
  "body": " How to Read Mathematics   Learning Goals    See suggestions for how to read math, and start thinking about how to implement these to best suit your needs and learning style    Learn how mathematics texts are organized around Definitions, Theorems, and Examples    There are many websites that provide guidance for students on how to read mathematics. Here are a few of them:    https:\/\/www.maa.org\/node\/121566 ,     https:\/\/web.stonehill.edu\/compsci\/History_Math\/math-read.htm ,     https:\/\/www.macalester.edu\/max\/math-econ-119\/howtoread\/ ,     https:\/\/brownmath.com\/stfa\/read.htm , and     https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1A0LT4BeL-J7Sw_jITi0iCwRnvYQut535\/view?usp=sharing      They all provide good advice and the main idea they all emphasize is that reading math (or really any technical writing) is going to take time and require your active involvement in order to understand what is written. However, you only have a limited amount of time in your day and you probably also have a very heavy workload, so you will need to read strategically, as well as actively.  Keep in mind as you read this section that you will need to take these ideas and experiment with them to find a system that works best for you. Just as everyone learns in different ways, everyone has a different way of reading that works best for them. If you have never learned mathematics by reading before, be patient with yourself and expect to improve over time as you adjust to the new format and refine your workflow.    Think about the following questions as you read.   Which of the ideas presented in this section resonate most with you?    Which strategies do you already employ?    What do you think you will start by trying?    How will you know if your reading method is working for you or requires changing?         General \"Do's\" for Reading Math  Here are some bits of general, practical advice to keep in mind while reading a math textbook. Some will work better for you and some will not, but you should keep an open mind about them all. If your methods are not producing the results you want, look through this list again and adopt some new methods that look like they will help with the issues you have identified.    Read multiple times and in multiple ways  You will almost certainly not understand or remember everything after a single reading! Expect to return to your notes and the textbook several times in order to fully grasp the material.    You may wish to skim through quickly first before reading a section in depth. Other people prefer to go through slowly first for details and then reread briefly to get the big picture. Try one or the other, depending on how much time and patience you have at the time.    If you are very confused by the reading before coming to class, return to the textbook after class and reread it to see how your new understanding helps the ideas fit together.    Return to definitions, theorems, formulas, and examples while working through homework problems. In particular, find any examples that seem to solve a similar problem.    \\text{ Do not } read through the textbook as a way to study for exams unless you have a specific purpose in doing so (creating a concept map, listing definitions, summarizing formulas, ). Reading the textbook without actively engaging with it is not an effective method of studying. See for tips on studying mathematics.      Read with paper and pencil (or tablet and stylus) nearby  You should take notes (especially of definitions and theorems) in a dedicated place in your notebook or tablet. Put key words in the margins so you can quickly skim your notes to find information. Underline or highlight as you would like, but be careful not to overuse such markings. Periodically summarize the big ideas of what you are reading, either by using appropriate headers or at the margins of your paper. If you do not already have your own note-taking method, I recommend the Cornell Note Taking System. You can find details at https:\/\/lsc.cornell.edu\/how-to-study\/taking-notes\/cornell-note-taking-system\/ . This involves organizing your page into multiple sections to capture different types of information: notes, cues (could be questions or key words), and summary. Math makes the most sense when you see it done out in front of you. One of the main challenges to reading mathematics is following lengthy computations. Working through these on paper at the same time as reading will help you follow each step, as well as pinpoint when you stop being able to follow the computation. This may not be the best to do the first time you read, however, as you may get lost in the details and forget why you were doing the computation. However, if you feel your eyes glazing in over in the middle of a lengthy equation, writing it down will help you focus, capture all of the details, and retain it in your memory.    Keep track of your questions  If something doesn't make sense, write down (in your notes) an explicit question that could help you understand. Flag your notes with post-its or stars or some other way that you can easily find them again; this is a benefit to Cornell notes as there is a separate area for questions. As you read more, you may answer your own questions and can add those answers to your notes. If not, you will want to be able to find these questions to ask them during class, office hours, or tutoring.    Avoid distractions while reading and choose your work environment deliberately  You may be able to read a novel or magazine with Netflix in the background or chatting with friends. If you read math and are not really concentrating on it, you will get very little out of it, and it will seem more difficult than it really is. 30 minutes spent focusing solely on your reading is more beneficial than spending 3 hours \"reading\" while distracted. If you are reading as part of a study group, make sure to set some ground rules about how often people are allowed to ask questions. Experiment with different environments to find what allows you to focus best. Silence the notifications on your phone\/computer\/tablet while you are reading! If that makes you uncomfortable, set a timer to check your notifications periodically (no more than every 15 minutes). Listening to music may be too distracting for you, or it may help you resist other distractions. Vary the type of music you listen to; some people prefer anything familiar while others need soothing or loud music. You may work better in a familiar environment, such as your dorm room, or you may need an impersonal space, such as the library. You may need a quiet, still space, or you may need ambient noise and bustle. Consider drinking water or another beverage while reading, or rewarding yourself periodically with a small snack such as an M&M. Mathematicians famously like to work in coffee shops, both for the ambient noise and the ease of obtaining more caffeine! Lastly, you will need to find what time of day works best for you for reading. You may prefer to read first thing in the morning when your brain is fresh, or you may think best in the evening or late at night when you do not have to think about what to do for the rest of the day. You may be forced to read at a particular time based on your schedule, but try to pay attention to when during the day your brain seems the most ready to focus and work.    Keep the big picture in mind  Even though the details of mathematics are important, the way that they fit together to work toward a larger goal give them real meaning. For each section you read, make sure you know the key ideas that are introduced as well as how they relate to the key ideas of previous sections. Cornell Notes (linked above) are great at helping to do this as they provide an explicit section of the page in which to summarize what you've learned. As you go through a calculation, always remember why that calculation is being done. What problem does it solve? What larger goal do the symbols represent? As you read an example, think about what definitions and theorems it illustrates, or if it shows how a mathematical concept can be used beyond the classroom. Ask what the motivation is behind the definitions and formulas; why was it worth inventing them in the first place?    Pay attention to details  In mathematics, every symbol and word counts, each sentence contributes to the bigger picture, and every diagram, table, and figure is purposeful. If you are at all uncertain about the meaning of a term or symbol, look it up or ask someone to explain it. Keep a list of new vocabulary. Pay attention to how symbols are used within mathematical expressions. For example, there is a vast difference between the symbols , and in mathematics. You probably won't have time to work through every example while you read, but at some point, make sure you know how to get from each step of a calculation to the next. In particular, be sure to notice when a definition, theorem, or formula is being applied, or if there is some other short-cut being used to get from one line to the next. Being able to follow a solution is a precursor to being able to solve problems for yourself. You may need to reread sentences a few times in order to fully understand what they are saying. Pay particular attention to how it relates to the material that has come before and how it fits into the current context. Is it introducing a new idea, building on an old idea, supporting a previous statement, pointing out something important, ?    Seek out alternate sources  This textbook contains all of the content you are responsible for, but that doesn't mean that it will contain enough examples or make perfect sense for every concept it introduces. Use other books, people, and technology to get answers to your questions and other perspectives on material that does not make sense to you. Do a quick internet search based on your questions, or ask your classmates, instructor, or tutors. YouTube is an excellent resource for modern learners of mathematics! However, be careful to find reputable sources for your information. Some of the best channels I've found are:    Khan Academy      The Organic Chemistry Tutor      patrickJMT      Professor Dave Explains      K. O. Math      Professor Heather Pierce Disclaimer: this is a friend of mine from graduate school, but she makes some great videos!      Numberphile (more for general interest; less instructional)     Hands on Math      Mathispower4u      ProfRobBob      Professor Leonard    If you prefer an alternate online textbook, here are two good options:    Paul's Online Math Notes      Active Calculus and Active Prelude to Calculus        Make it your own  The most important thing to do while reading math is to find a system that works for you and to make the content that you are learning relevant to your own interests. Everyone has a different set of tools and a different level of \"chunking up\" complicated ideas. Make the idea fit in with your own perspective and experience. Some people are most satisfied when they see a mathematical idea unfold from start to finish, following an idea from its origins and rediscovering why it is true, either via logical reasoning or experimentation. Other people need to contextualize information in a real-world context, in which case they prefer to motivate an idea with an application or tangible problem.

Definitions, Examples, and Theorems  The last section held general advice. This one contains specific directions for making sure you catch the most important parts of your reading. Pay special attention to definitions, examples, and theorems in a math text. They generally contain the most useful information and are the structure used to organize a mathematical text.   Definitions  Mathematics uses words very precisely, and not always in the same way that you would use them in your daily life. Mathematical definitions give the precise meaning of certain words that are meant to represent a specific idea. Words are typically written in bold the first time they are defined, which is intended to make them stand out from the surrounding text. If they are especially important, they are numbered and labeled, like so:  The words function, function notation, independent variable, and dependent variable are defined. The definition is numbered and has an orange bar to the left to make it more visible.   The above definition may or may not make sense to you or agree with what you think of when you hear the word \"function.\" If you don't immediately understand a definition, you may need to come back to it again later after reading some examples, asking questions, or finding alternate explanations of the term via Google or YouTube. When you encounter a new mathematical definition, you should write the term in your notes along with the accompanying definition, along with any other ideas that help you to understand it. While trying to be as precise as possible, write the mathematical meaning of the word in your own words, potentially accompanied by an example or two to help understand what the definition is intended to mean.    Theorems and Formulas  A mathematical Theorem is typically extremely important. If definitions are stones and examples show you how to put them together, then a theorem is a finished archway or wall. It is a mathematical fact, formula, classification, or connection between ideas that is especially useful for some purpose or is the culmination of a string of ideas leading to a particular goal. Think of mathematical knowledge as the city that is made up of houses constructed from the walls and archways of Theorems.  Definitions are put together to form Theorems. Theorems fit together to form a body of knowledge, such as the Theory of Calculus.   Theorems can also be called Propositions, Corollaries, or Lemmas , though we will not get into the distinction between these, and are typically so important that they are separated from the surrounding text in a shaded box. They are numbered so that they can be referred to easily:   Theorem 1.1 is a \"classification\" and gives a visual condition that categorizes a graph as either a function or not a function. The theorem also has a name by which it is commonly referred: the Vertical Line Test. Names of theorems often serve to remind us of their contents, though sometimes they refer to the person who discovered the theorem.   Theorem 1.2 is a \"formula\" and provides a short-cut for factoring the difference of two numbers or expressions that are written as squares.   Theorem 1.3 tells us a mathematical \"fact\" about products of numbers or expressions that are equal to zero. This is a very important property that relies on the theoretical structure of real numbers and real-valued functions. Theorem 1.3 is also the connection between the algebraic method of factoring and the task of solving an equation. Whenever you see a theorem, you should add it to you notes and take extra special care that you understand the purpose and meaning of the theorem. Because this course will not focus on mathematical proofs (logical arguments that explain rigorously why a theorem is true), you may or may not fully understand why a theorem is always true. The text should provide enough examples to suggest why it is true, or you could come up with a few more examples on your own if you are not yet convinced.    Examples and Non-Examples  It's not usually possible to get a full understanding of a concept without seeing it used a few times. The purpose of examples is to build your intuitive understanding, either by motivating an idea, clarifying details of a definition, theorem, or formula, showing how the idea can be used in context or to solve a problem, or providing multiple viewpoints from which to think about an idea. They may be mentioned briefly in a paragraph and you will have to recognize them via key words like, \"For instance \" and \" such as \". Other times, they are contained in separate environments meant to call more attention to them:   Example 1.1 follows immediately after Definition 1.1 in the text and illustrates the idea of a function introduced there, as well as the terms independent and dependent variable. It also introduces a new symbol and its meaning, the set of all real numbers. If Definition 1.1 did not make sense to you when you read it earlier, return to it and compare it with this example to see how the abstracted ideas in the definition are made more concrete in this example.   Example 1.22 follows Theorem 1.2 in the text as shown, and demonstrates how to use the formula presented for factoring a difference of squares.   Example 1.23 follows Theorem 1.3 in the text as shown. It begins with an expression that was factored in a previous example, and demonstrates how the property of multiplication in Theorem 1.3 allows us to set each of the factored expressions equal to zero and solve in order to determine where the full expression is equal to zero. The example goes on to contextualize the calculation graphically and provides a clickable link to a Desmos graph (you should always click on these as you are reading) in order to verify that the algebraic work is correct. A \"non-example\" is typically an example of something that does not fit a mathematical idea.   Example 1.8 illustrates how Theorem 1.1, the Vertical Line Test, is applied, and also provides an example of a graph that is NOT a function, meaning a \"non-example\" of a function. Non-examples are often just as enlightening as examples, if not more-so, because they show the limitations of the mathematical idea.     The four examples above illustrate definitions and theorems found in the text. Example 1.23 also makes connections to methods demonstrated in another example and a way of verifying and visualizing the result of a calculation. Some examples may illustrate a general method of solving a category of problems. Motivational examples may give you an intuitive or contextual introduction into an idea, while applied examples show you how a mathematical idea can be used in a real-world problem.  Here is a list of strategies to experiment with that can help you get the most benefit from the examples provided in the textbook. You do not have to implement all of them all of the time, but should consider these as suggestions to add to your toolbox of reading strategies:   Whenever you see an example, you should always think about what purpose it is serving. A good question to ask yourself is, \"How is this an example of what I was just reading?\"    Some examples will pose a problem to be solved and demonstrate how to solve it. Think about how to answer the problem, even for just a moment, before you read the solution. If you don't know where to start or were very wrong, you know you did not understand the concept underlying the example and may want to skim over earlier material again after reading the solution.    Summarize the main idea of an example after reading it and how it relates to the definition, theorem, formula, idea, etc. that it is meant to illustrate.    Make note of any questions that come into your mind as you read the example, such as how to get from one step of a calculation to the next, or whether the same idea could be used in a different context.    Try to think of other similar examples, as well as non-examples, before moving on to a new topic.       Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: Definition, theorem, proposition, corollary, lemma, example and non-example  Key ideas: Reading mathematics requires you to be actively involved in order to understand what is written. You will have to find a balance between efficiency and thoroughness in order to effectively learn from a mathematical text without spending hours and hours reading. This will likely take some experimentation with different strategies, so be patient and give yourself time to build this important skill.  \\fbox{Remember to return to Canvas and complete the Section 0.1 R&R!}  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 0.1}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "title": "How to Problem-Solve",
  "body": " How to Problem-Solve    Attribution: The framework and contents of this section were developed by Dr. Juliana Belding for the course MATH1100 Calculus I at Boston College, reproduced here with permission.    Learning Goals    Learn a framework for tackling complicated problems    Practice implementing the framework    Dispel some common myths about problem-solving      Why Problem Solving?   Problem-solving can mean many things. One way to describe it is as the ability to take an unfamiliar problem, make sense of the problem and come up with a way to solve it.  We'll work with both word problems and other problems. In particular, word problems are a training ground for the skill of mathematizing a situation that has words and numbers. We're not pretending these are necessarily realistic word problems but the point is for you to further develop your skills in more simplified situations and build your confidence. The hope is that this helps you become more comfortable looking at situations in a mathematical way, as you encounter more complicated ones.  Here we share a framework This framework is modified from that generated by George Polya, with credit also to Gizem Kaarali, Darly Cooper, Walter and Brown. to help you approach problems in an organized way. We'll explain it below and give examples of how you might use it.   Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Make a Plan    Carry out Your Plan    Reflect Back    Critique and\/or Change the Problem      Why a Framework?    A framework provides a structure to support logical problem-solving and slows you down, which is a good thing at first. As opposed to worrying that you can't remember how to solve the problem immediately, you get used to brainstorming and taking time to make sense of the problem.    A framework provides a common language so students in different sections can better work with each other and with instructors and TAs from other sections.     Very Important!! We are NOT suggesting that there is always one way to approach a math problem. This framework is meant to support you to work on a problem in a systematic yet individual, creative way. In particular,   In homework or class, we'll periodically ask you to try to use the framework. You will not be graded on precise use of the framework, but instead on the work shown and final results of your problem-solving.    We may model using the framework in class and in written solutions. Your work might look different or occur in different order than examples we provide. That is fine!    You may have a different approach to problem-solving that you like to use. That is fine! This is not meant to replace that, but rather to provide a(nother) pathway to problem-solving.       Problem-Solving Framework  Here's the framework. Warning! It can be overwhelming to read all at once. Instead we recommend you try an example problem alongside. Keep track of the things you do, and then come back to the framework, and see how it might help with solving the problem.   An Example Problem   A swimming pool is 2 m deep, 5 m wide and 60 m long. Water is pumped into it at the constant rate of 100 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the pool?  (Source: Cooper, 3.1.6)       Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)  Here are some possible things to do to help you understand the problem. You don't need to necessarily do all of them or to do them in a particular order.   Read it over once.    Visualize if possible: draw a diagram or picture, or sketch a rough graph.    Focus on what is being asked: What is the unknown information or the goal of the problem? What information is known?    Identify different quantities that might be relevant. Are they constant? Are they variables? Are they parameters?    Define notation and variables. Translate known and unknown information into notation and variables.       Make a Plan  In this step, the big point is to slow down and allow yourself to think versus trying to rely on a memorized approach. You brainstorm what could be relevant or useful to know or to do, and then make a plan to do it. You can actually carry out the plan in the next step. Here are some questions to help you.   What connections or relationships are there between known and unknown quantities? Does one change with the other?    What math tools, concepts, or formulas might be relevant?    Would making a table, function formula or graph be useful?    Is this like any familiar problem?   Then   Read over the problem again and decide which of the tools, relationships, are actually relevant and useful and make a step-by-step plan to use them.   It is important to note that your plan might not be the same as another person's. There are many pathways to solve a problem! Also, you may have done some work in \"Meet the Problem\" that helps you make a plan. These two steps are very connected.    Carry out Your Plan  In this step, you actually do the work of the plan, computing a value, graphing, solving an equation or whatever you planned.   Along the way, look back at what you planned. Are you on track?    Do you need to modify your plan?       Reflect Back (Looking Back)  In this step, we look back to see if we've solved the problem, check our work and think about what we've learned. Here are some questions to help you.   Have you answered the question(s)?    Can you check your answer?    Did you include units, if necessary? Do a unit check: do the units make sense?    Can you interpret the answer? Does it make sense?    Was all of the information relevant or needed?    Does the answer fit your intuition? What surprised you, if anything?       Critique and Change the Problem  This is an optional step, but it is a great way to exercise your critical thinking, get curious and creative, and think about how the problem might connect to more real-world situations.   Were assumptions made in the problem? What were they? Are they reasonable?    \"Word Problems\" in math classes are notoriously artificial. In what ways is the problem NOT realistic or practical? How could you change it to better reflect reality?    How would you change the problem to make it more interesting?    What other questions are you curious about after solving this problem?          Some Myths of Problem-Solving     Myth: If you can't solve a problem in 5 minutes, this means you can't do it  Definitely not! It might mean re-reading the problem to see it with new eyes, taking a break, or talking to a friend, classmate, or instructor about what you are thinking (but not asking them how to do it).    Myth: There is only one way to solve a problem  There are many ways to solve most every problem. We are sharing a framework, not a formula. Your work using this framework may look different than your peers or instructor.    Myth: Problems only have one right answer.  While this will be true of most of the problems we do in this course, in many situations, there are a range of answers depending on the assumptions and parameters of the problems.       Examples of Worked Problems  This section contains a few examples to help you understand the framework. Try the problems first using the framework, then see the examples here.  You'll notice that there is NOT one way to use the framework. You might have written more or less than here. The author here included some side thoughts, too, in parentheses. As you solve problems, you should feel free to add your personality and make it your own!   Here is a worked solution to Example . Remember: there are many ways to apply this framework! Your process may vary substantially to what is shown below.    Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Our goal is the time in minutes for filling the pool.    We know the dimensions of the pool. 60 m, 5 m, 2 m    The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is . It looks like this:  The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is .       We know the rate of water into the pool is 100 liters per minute.    Total Amount is rate time.      Make a Plan Here's one sample plan.    Find the volume.    Divide by the filling rate to find the time: , so .    The dimensions of the pool are in meters but the rate is in liters per minute. So we'll have to find a conversion before dividing or change units afterwards. We can use that 1 m  1,000 liters. A quick Google search will tell you this. We have a choice: cubic meters to liters or from liters to cubic meters? Let's do the first one An alternate plan: Convert the rate 100 L\/min to a rate with units cubic meters per minute. You get a rate of 0.1 cubic meters per minute. .       Carry out Your Plan   Volume cubic meters.    Now we need to convert. We want to convert cubic meters to liters. Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 L, the total volume in liters is L. (More than I expected!)    Divide by the filling rate to find the time. Since , we have , so .       Reflect Back (Looking back)   Did we answer the problem? It said \"how long\"? So 6,000 minutes. This is hard to think about, so how many days would this take? There are minutes in a day, so this is about 4 days.    This seems too long. Did we make an error? Did we forget a zero? After checking, we see we did not.    We always want to check units. Here's where we might catch ourselves if we forgot to convert, since we'd get units of cubic meters per (liters\/minute) which is not just minutes.    This seems like a long time, but this is a big pool (60 m is longer than an Olympic pool).       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This pool is odd-shaped. It's long but not that deep. How does it compare to an Olympic-size swimming pool?    It might not be realistic for the rate to be always constant. What happens if the rate varies?    Can we make a function to predict the volume at any point in time?    What if the pool also leaks water, or if there is a circulation of water in and out?          The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers, and someone has just made a metal band that circles the Earth, touching the ground at all locations. You come along at night, as a practical joke, and add 10 m to its length. The band is now sits magically just above the ground at all locations creating a gap.  How far is the new band above the ground: could a flea, a rabbit or even a person pass underneath it?  (Source: Band around the Earth Puzzle)    Here we work through all steps of the framework. Note: your work might look different or occur in different steps!    Meet the Problem ((Understanding the Problem)    We know the original band has circumference about 40,000 km.    The new band has circumference which is 10 m longer, so 40,000 km + 10 m.    We need to know how much space is created between the band and the earth.    Here a picture is worth a lot:  A band around the Earth that has been lengthened by 10 m.   From the picture, we see the space we want is the difference in the radius of the bands. We have the original radius and the new radius .    I wonder what can fit? 10 m seems small compared to the total circumference, so I'm guessing a flea.      Make a Plan   We can measure the space using the radius: The space is the difference between the new band radius and the original band radius.    The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we can use to find the original radius .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, so we can use to find the new radius . We need to convert 10 m to km first.    Then subtract the original radius from the new radius.    Then we can compare that to the height of typical things.     An alternate plan: There are other ways to approach this. For example, we can name the gap , since it's the change in radius. Then , and . The difference in circumference is 10 m and it's so we can solve for that gap.    Carry out Your Plan   The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we solve to find the original radius, .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, which is 40,000.01 km. We solve for ,    The space is km, or 1.6 meters.    1 meter is 3 feet, so this 4.8 feet. This is enough for person to pass under (if they bend down). Surprising!       Reflect Back (Looking Back)   I'm surprised it's this big a gap. I need to check I converted everything correctly.    I notice that it doesn't seem to matter how big the original circumference is because . The change in radius only depends on the change in circumference, not the original circumference.       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This is a strange problem - how could we make a band around the earth? Also, why is this a funny joke?    The earth isn't perfectly spherical. How does that affect it? Does it matter where we add the 10 meters?    Does it matter the size of the sphere? Would this be true on the moon? On Mars?    What sort of application could this have?    What can we learn about how radius and circumference are related?           The Northeast Regular train leaves NY for Boston at noon going a constant rate of 55 mph.

  "title": "How to Study Math",
  "body": " How to Study Math  Math is a subject best learned in small increments over a long period of time. Cramming for hours at a time is not an effective way to learn mathematics. The best thing you can do to help you study is to schedule relatively short (30 minutes - 1 hour) study sessions for yourself spaced out over the course of several days or weeks, as often as needed based on the amount of improvement you wish to achieve and how much material you hope to cover.  Leading up to an exam, you may wish to lengthen your study sessions, but do not push yourself past the point of mental fatigue. You will simply get frustrated and will not retain the material you review. Avoid working on math when tired. Think about the times of day when you are best able to focus and try to study during them.  Most importantly, find other students with whom to study . Do not work with someone far above or below your own level of understanding, but rather someone with whom you can exchange ideas equitably. Take turns suggesting problems or topics to review and explaining solutions and ideas to each other. Ideally, each of you understands what the other does not. However, you will also benefit from combining your partial understandings. The social interaction involved in working with another person will help you retain the information you learn. At the very least, making plans with another person to study will hold you accountable for using that time as intended.    Resources you can use to study  Plan when you begin studying to give yourself enough time to attend office hours or tutoring to ask questions. The resources below are available to you in order to identify what you need to know:    Your notes from reading and from class    Problems from in-class worksheets and the posted solutions    Old Check-Your-Understanding problems. Some have solutions that you can view after the due date.    Homework problems and posted solutions    Online resources, such as YouTube or online textbooks. There are specific suggestions in . Seeing an alternate explanation and additional examples may help you understand a topic. Just be aware that different sources do not all cover topics in the same way and material that you find online may not be relevant to the course; if something seems entirely unfamiliar and you can't find something similar in course materials, chances are it's not something you are responsible for knowing.    Explanations and examples in the textbook. Warning: Many people try to study by simply reading through a text from start to finish. This is not an effective way to learn. If you plan to read the textbook to study, you need to read actively. See below for details on active reading as it pertains to mathematical texts.      How to study effectively  A great way to begin your studying is to create a concept map of the big ideas being tested on the exam. Include all of the relevant definitions, theorems, and formulas. Reread comments left on homework and see which Check-Your-Understanding problems took you the most attempts to get correct. Do not study everything, but rather focus on those topics that give you the most trouble.     Practice Problems Math is best learned by actively solving problems. When practicing problems, complete them on your own with as little help from your notes or another person as possible. Only resort to consulting other resources when you are stuck and have already tried to get un-stuck.     Use Homework as Assessment Similar to the above point, use the work that you already have to do as a way to assess your understanding as you do it. Avoid copying methods from examples and their solutions but rather review your notes and then try the problem without looking.     Check your Solutions Use solutions to check your own work. If you get the same final answer, make sure that the intervening steps are the same or at least equivalent. If you use a different method to complete a problem than the solutions, compare them: Where do they differ? Which is more efficient? Which is more applicable to other, similar problems? If you do not get the same final answer, determine how much of your work is correct and precisely what kind of mistake you made.    If your mistake was based on faulty conceptual understanding, review or make a note to review material related to that concept.    If your mistake was computational, what can you do in the future to avoid the same mistake? If you find yourself consistently making the same computational mistakes, make a mental note to double-check your work whenever doing similar calculations.       Write Your own Practice Exams Combine problems from homework and worksheets and either do them yourself, or trade with a study partner. Having to solve a problem out of the context of a section of the text is a test-like challenge that is good to practice. Moreover, anticipating which problems are \"test-worthy\" and thinking from the perspective of the instructor can help you to anticipate the types of problems that will be on the exam.     Learn by Teaching and Learn as if to Teach Explaining an idea will make it stick better in your mind, so take turns in your study group explaining problems to each other. When working on your own, don't study with the intention of solving problems: study with the intention of teaching other people to solve problems. How much more thoroughly would you prepare to give a 50-minute lecture than you would to take a 50-minute test? Study as if you will be standing at the front of the class giving explanations, rather than sitting in a seat working on paper.     Review the Theory Review the definitions and theorems covered in class. Do not simply read through them, however. Find examples (from homework, the book, online) that relate back to them and explicitly connect the example with the ideas in the theory. Give a few examples that fit the definition or theorem, and try to find examples that do not fit. Compare them and determine what differences make the definition or theorem apply\/not apply.     Review the Computation Review all of the formulas and methods covered in class. Ideally, homework has given you enough practice with these so that you retain them. If not, find additional problems to practice. If you find yourself having a very hard time applying these quickly, make yourself a study sheet (maybe a notecard or a separate piece of paper) where you copy over the formula\/method and write out an example or two using that method. Briefly review this study sheet several times a day.   If using a notecard, you may wish to put the formula\/method on one side and examples on the other side.    If using a piece of paper, fold it down the middle and put the formula\/method and examples on opposite sides of the crease.        Read Actively Many people like to review their notes or the textbook to study. However, simply reading through explanations and examples is not an effective way to learn material. Do not confuse familiarity with understanding. You must read actively to benefit from reading, which for mathematics means:   Rework any examples or computations (with a pen or pencil on a separate piece of paper). Make a note of any steps you do not follow but don't let them get in your way of continuing to read. It's possible something included later in the text will clear up your confusion.    Identify the main idea of the section as well as the main idea of each subsection or paragraph. Connect these ideas: how does the material in the section support the main idea? How does the main idea of the section tie together the ideas of each subsection? There's no need to formally summarize your reading, but it's very useful to think about the big picture ideas as a way of understanding the details.    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to explicit examples that relate to them. Why do these examples fit? What change in the example would make it no longer fit? How are the specific details of the theory represented in the problem (for example, if there are constants used in the theorem, like a and b, that are given specific values in the example).    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to other sections covered in the text. What ideas does this section use? Where are these ideas used in subsequent sections?    If there are any words that you do not understand, look them up! If they were previously defined in the book, they will be listed in the index. If you can't find where they are defined, you can always google them. Just make sure that you are looking at a relevant mathematical definition. Oftentimes, words are defined to have very specific mathematical meanings that are not the same as their colloquial use. Sometimes, different areas of mathematics will use the same words to mean different things, so make sure the definition you find is familiar or seems relevant.        Seek Help from your Instructor The best place to get help is office hours. These are times your instructor has set aside to meet with students. You do not need an appointment to go. Questions can be about specific problems but can also be more general. Do not go with a laundry list of questions to get answered right before an exam, but rather attend office hours regularly and ask a few questions each time. Formulate your question (and write it down) ahead of time so that you can use the face-to-face time with your instructor productively. Bring any work you have attempted on a problem and show your instructor so that they can pick up precisely where you need help.      \\part{Fall Semester}  "

Recognize when a relationship is or is not a function; the Vertical Line Test.    Use different notations to describe sets: inequalities and intervals.    Explore some preliminary examples of functions used in real-world contexts.       The Definition of a Function  A function is a fundamental mathematical object that will form the basis of everything we study in this course. In this section, we will explore their definition and its meaning, several ways of representing a function, and a physical example of how functions are manifest in real-world phenomena.  What does the word \"function\" mean to you? Pause for a moment and consider   If you look up \"function\" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary (click on this link: https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function ), there are many different meanings. Which ones agree with the ideas you already had? The fifth entry  https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function accessed August 1, 2022 is the one we shall use, and we shall use both parts of it:   function (noun)   a mathematical correspondence that assigns exactly one element of one set to each element of the same or another set;    a variable (such as a quality, trait, or measurement) that depends on and varies with another For example \"Height is a function of age.\"   Part (a) of this definition is the abstracted, theoretical idea of a function. Part (b) of this definition is the reason we are interested in functions: we wish to describe relationships between real-world quantities. We will begin with the abstract idea before applying this knowledge to something more concrete.  In we give a formal, mathematical statement that we shall take to be the precise meaning of the word function . Return to this definition as you read the examples that follow in order to make sense of the notation and terminology.  To make our definition as rigorous as possible, we will make use of some notions and notation related to the mathematical theory of sets that we now officially introduce.   Sets and set membership      set membership    A set  is a collection of objects, called the members or elements of . We write if the object is a member of , and if is not a member of .  In the special case when a set consists of the finitely many elements , we write . Similarly, if the elements of are given by the infinite list , we write . The set descriptions in and are called enumerations or enumerative descriptions .     Set membership   Let . Since , , and are elements of , we have . Since is not an element of , we have .        We are now ready to define a function.   Function    a function from to    Let and be sets. A function  from to , denoted , is a rule which, given any input  , returns an output  . We write in this case, and call the image of under , or the value of at . Similarly, we say  maps (or sends ) the input to the output .  The set is called the domain of ; the set is called the codomain of .     Independent and dependent variables  The essential detail in the definition of a function , is that for each input in our domain the functions assigns a unique output in our codomain . This detail introduces a fundamental asymmetry between the roles of the variable and the variable in the context of the function . We codify this asymmetry with the terms independent variable and dependent variable .  In more detail, we call the variable , which is allowed to range freely over all elements of the domain , an independent variable of ; and we call the variable a dependent variable of , as given any input , the output is determined by .    Squaring function   Consider the rule that takes as input any real number and returns as an output the square of that number. This rule defines a function since for any real number , its square is uniquely determined.  Let's flesh out all the details of the function , as well as the accompanying notation. Observe that the phrase takes as input any real number implies that the domain of is , the set of all real numbers. Since the square of a real number is itself a real number, we see that we can also set our codomain to be .  Thus, in full and glorious detail, is the function defined as for all .  Letting and denote the independent and dependent variables of , respectively, we write or to represent the fact that the values of are the result of squaring , or equivalently, applying the function to .  Looking at some concrete examples of applied to various inputs, observe that we have . Using the language of , this means that the value of at is , and the value of at is also (or alternatively, maps both and to the output ).     Squaring function  The two input\/output statements from nicely illustrate the asymmetry in the roles of independent variable and dependent variable mentioned in . Whereas, by definition, corresponding to each input of a function there is a unique output , it is not necessarily the case that for each output of the function there is a unique input that gets mapped to it. In this case, we see that the output is the value of at two different inputs: and . More on this later, when we discuss invertible functions.   Intimately related to the squaring operation on is the notion of square roots. Recall that given a real number , a (real) square root of is a number satisfying . For example, is a square root of , since . It is possible to define a function based on square roots, but we have to proceed with caution, as the next example illustrates.   Square roots: a non-example   Explain why the following proposed rule does not define a function : given a real number , define to be the square root of .    There are two issues with this proposed function.   Firstly, not every real number has a (real) square root! Consider , for example. We cannot have for a real number since for any and . More generally, no negative real number has a square root.    The specific issue described in (1) is easily remedied by replacing our domain with the smaller domain of all nonnegative numbers , since it is a (nontrivial) fact that every nonnegative real number has a square root. However, a separate issue arises preventing from being a well-defined function. Namely, with the exception of , a nonnegative number has two distinct square roots. For example, the number has two square roots: and . This means there is no such thing as the square root, even if we restrict our attention to nonnegative numbers! Since our rule fails to assign a unique output for each input of the domain, it fails to be a function.       Our discussion of laid bare two issues that arise when defining a function that computes square roots: (1) not all real numbers have a square root; and (2) positive real numbers have two distinct square roots (if is a square root of , then so is ). The principal square root function defined in sorts these issues out by taking as its domain the set of all nonnegative real numbers (since nonnegative numbers do have square roots) and choosing for each nonnegative integer its unique nonnegative square root (only one of and will be nonnegative).   Principal square root function    the nonnegative square root of    Given any nonnegative real number , we denote by its unique nonnegative square root, and we call the principal square root of (or more casually, the radical of ).  Let be the set of all nonnegative real numbers . The function defined as is called the principal square root function .     Principal square root  Texts (and instructors) can be pretty sloppy when dealing with the principal square root operation, often referring to the expression as the square root of . This seemingly innocuous mistake can lead to larger misconceptions down the line. As such you are encouraged to adopt the following habit: each time you see utter to yourself the nonnegative square root of .     What are two other examples of functions that you can think of? These may be mathematical examples that you have seen before, or they may be real-world examples of a quantity that varies depending on another. Try to be creative!      Set-builder notation and intervals  In order to describe the domains, codomains, and ranges (see below) of functions we will need some more set theory concepts and notation.   Subsets  sets subset  sets inclusion    set inclusion     proper set inclusion    A set is a subset of a set , denoted , if every member of is a member of : , implies . The relation is called set inclusion .     Set-builder notation  sets set builder notation   Let be a set, and let be a property that elements of either satisfy or do not satisfy. For an element , let denote the statement that satisfies property . The set of all elements of that satisfy property is denoted .    Set-builder notation is a convenient means of carving out an interesting subset from an existing set using a defining property. For example, the set of all nonnegative real numbers, which appeared as the domain of the principal square root function, can be described using set-builder notation as . The next example uses set-builder notation to describe some familiar subsets of the integers .   Subsets of integers   We denote the set of all integers as : , we have .  Identify each set below as a familiar subset of and provide an enumerative description of the set.                        Using , we see that is the set of integers satisfying the property of being greater than 0. In other words, is precisely the set of positive integers. We can describe enumeratively as .    Again following , we see that is the set of all integers satisfying the property that they are equal to for some integer . Said another way, is the set of integers that are multiples of . Such integers are called even , and we conclude that is the set of all even integers. We can enumerate as .    Similar reasoning as above leads us to conclude that is the set of all odd integers: .       When dealing with subsets of it is often convenient to make use of interval notation . Intervals are special types of subsets of . Roughly speaking, for a subset of to be an interval means that if contains two elements and , then it also contains all real numbers between  an . The set of nonegative integers is an interval, and is expressed using interval notation as . Graphically we represent such an interval as a line segment (or ray) extending over a portion of the number line.   Number line representation of      Instead of burdening you with a formal definition of intervals, we simply provide in examples of various kinds of intervals. In that table and are assumed to be real numbers satisfying .   Intervals and interval notation    Interval notation  Set-builder notation  Interval type      Closed (finite) interval      Closed (infinite) interval      Closed (infinite) interval      Open (finite) interval      Open (infinite) interval      Open (infinite) interval      Half-open or half-closed interval      Half-open or half-closed interval          Note that, roughly speaking, a square bracket ( and ) indicates the inclusion of the corresponding number in the interval, whereas a parenthesis indicates that the number is excluded. Graphically speaking a number being included or excluded from the interval is indicated by either a closed (solid) or open dot, respectively.   Included and excluded elements of intervals    The interval     The interval       Not all subsets of are intervals. For example the set is not itself an interval. That said, we can also describe such sets as unions of intervals.   Set union and intersection    the union of and     the intersection of and    Let and be subsets of a common set .   The union of and , denoted is defined as the set of all elements of that lie either in or : , .    The intersection of and , denoted is defined as the set of all elements of that lie both in and : , .        Union of intervals   Let . Express as a union of intervals and represent graphically on the number line.    For an element to not be in is equivalent to either being less than or greater than : , we have or . Thus we have . We represent graphically as follows.   Union of two intervals      At this point we have introduced a number of important sets and their corresponding notation. Let's make these official with a definition. We also take the opportunity to add one more important set to our repertoire: the empty set .   Important sets    the integers     the real numbers     the empty set    The following is a preliminary list of some important sets.   Empty set  The empty set , denoted or , is the set that contains no elements.    Integers  The integers , denoted , is the set of all whole numbers and their negatives: , .    The set of real numbers is denoted . We do not give an explicit definition of this number system, but rather take it as a given.         Implied domain and range  According to , to give a complete definition of a function, we need to specify three things: the domain of the function, its codomain, and the rule that defines the value of the function at each of its inputs. Consequently, a statement like is technically speaking not a complete definition of a function, since it does not specify the domain and codomain in question. So as not to get bogged down by such technicalities, we hereby adopt the following convention in the form of an official decree, or fiat .   Implied domain   If a function is introduced via a formula without specifying a domain or codomain, we will assume that the codomain is and that the implied domain  is the set of all real numbers for which the formula can be meaningfully evaluated.     Implied domain: reciprocal function   Let be the function defined as . Following , give a full definition of this function by determining the codomain and implied domain. Use interval notation to describe these sets.    Since is only given as a formula, following , the codomain of is and the implied domain is the set of all real numbers for which the formula makes sense. Since the fraction is well-defined if and only of , we conclude that the domain of is the set of all nonzero real numbers: , . Thus, in all its glorious detail, and using interval notation, is the function defined as .    In addition to the domain and codomain of a function, another important set associated to it is the set of all possible outputs. Consider again the function , whose domain and codomain, following , are both equal to . You may recall, however, that squares of real numbers are in fact nonnegative real numbers: , for all . This means that the set of outputs of is strictly smaller than the codomain as it does not contain any negative real numbers. There is nothing wrong with this. In general, the codomain of a function should be thought of simply as a target set that the outputs of land in; our function definition does not insist that every element of the codomain must be an output of the function. That said, the set of all outputs of a function is important to us, and as such warrants an official name: the range of the function.   Range    the range of the function    The range of a function , denoted , is the set of all outputs of . Using set-builder notation , we have , or equivalently, .     Range depends on domain  Note that the definition of the range of a function depends very much on the domain , since it is the set of all outputs of the form , where . This is one reason why when defining a function we must know precisely what the domain is.  For example consider the two following functions: , ; , . Although the functions are defined using the same rule, since they have different domains, they are strictly speaking different functions. This difference is reflected in their having different ranges. Indeed, an argument along the lines of the ones given in and reveals that . As a result, when computing the range of a function, it is absolutely essential to know precisely what the domain of the function is.    Range: squaring function   Let be defined as . Compute , expressed using interval notation.    First we apply to determine the codomain and implied domain of . As always in this setting, the codomain is . Furthermore, since the defining expression of makes sense for any real number, we conclude that the domain of is and we write .  Next, by definition, we have . Since for all , and since every element of is of the form for some , we see that all elements of are nonnegative, and hence that . As you might have guessed, this set inclusion is in fact an equality: , we claim that .  To prove this claim, it remains only to show the reverse set inclusion: , that every nonnegative real number is an element of , or equivalently, that if , then we have for some . This in turn is equivalent to showing that if , then we can solve the equation for . Thankfully, this is not so difficult. Indeed, given any , the number satisfies . (Of course, is another solution to , but we only needed to provide one.) Putting it all together, we conclude that given any , we have , where . This shows that every nonnegative real number is an element of , and completes the proof that .     Range: principal square-root function   Let be defined as . Compute , expressed using interval notation.    Firstly, we observe that the implied domain of is , since the expression is only defined for nonnegative real numbers . We claim that . Indeed, since by definition is the nonnegative square root of , we have for all , and hence that . For the other direction, note that given any , we have . Thus for all , we have , where , and thus . We conclude that , as claimed.      Tables and graphs  In , you saw two different ways of representing the same function: a description in words (a rule that squares numbers), and a description via a formula ( ). In this subsection we introduce two additional forms of representation of a function: tables and graphs . This makes a grand total of four ways to represent a function:   a description in words    a formula    a table    a graph   We will need to be able to work with all four of these representations. Depending on what information we are given and what questions we have, one may be more or less useful than another.  A table (or table of values) for a function is just a rectangular display of a collection of inputs of together with their corresponding outputs (or values). For example, in here are two tables for the function that differ both in their choice of inputs and the manner in which the table is oriented.   Two tables for         x f(x)    0 0    1 1    2 4         x  -2  -1  0 1 2    f(x) 4 1 0 1 4       As illustrated by , a table of values of a function in general only provides partial information about that function: that is, it only tells us the values of the function for the chosen inputs, and remains silent regarding any other inputs. Indeed, the table in (b) above, by adding a few additional inputs, tells us something interesting about that the table in (a) did not reveal: namely, that sends multiple inputs to the same output.  A table would give us a complete representation of a function if it included the outputs for all of the possible inputs of : , if it displayed the input\/output pairs for all in the domain of . If the domain of happens to be an interval in , it is of course impossible to list all these input\/output pairs . In this setting a graph of the function can provide a useful means of visualizing all of the input\/output pairs of the function.   Cartesian plane   The Cartesian plane (or -plane ), denoted , is the set of all pairs of real numbers : , .     Graph of a function   Let be a function, where . The graph of , denoted , is the set of all pairs , where : , .    Producing a detailed graph of a function by hand is in general a challenging task. Indeed, in this course we develop sophisticated techniques based on calculus for doing just this! One way of proceeding, however, is to begin with a table of values for the function, plotting the resulting input\/output pairs in , and then extrapolating to get a full graph.  For example, starting with the table of values of in (b) of and adding a few additional input\/out pairs ( , ), we are able to produce a convincing graph of .   A graph of the function .    With a solid understanding of the precise relation between a function and its graph, you will be able to easily translate visual features of the graph into corresponding properties of the function. As a general rule of thumb, horizontal features of the graph of a function tell us something about the inputs of , and vertical features tell us about its outputs.  For example, to infer the domain of a function from its graph, we simply take note of all the -values of points on the graph. This can be done visually by mentally projecting the points of the graph onto the -axis and seeing what subset is produced. Similarly, the range of the function corresponds to the set of all -values of points appearing in the graph, and this can be visualized by projecting all of the points of the graph onto the -axis. Looking at the graph of given in , and imagining this graph as continuing in a similar manner indefinitely to the left and right, we see that projecting points onto the -axis produces the entire -axis, whereas projecting onto the -axis yields only the nonnegative portion of the -axis. This is visual confirmation that the domain of is all of , whereas the range of is just .  The following examples further illustrate this technique.   Graph: radical function   The graph of the function is given .   Use the graph to infer what the domain of is. Confirm your answer by computing the implied domain of .    Use the graph to infer what the range of is.      A graph of the function .         We see that the -values of points on the graph of seem to range over all real numbers less than or equal to . This suggests that the domain of is . To confirm this observe that the expression is defined only if . Now solve this inequality for : . We conclude that is defined if and only if , confirming that the domain of is .    The -values of the points of the graph of appear to range over all of . We thus infer that the range of is . (And indeed, this claim is readily confirmed using arguments as in and .)        Graph: rational function   An interactive graph of the function is given in .   Use the interactive to infer what the domain of is. Confirm your answer by computing the implied domain of .    Use the interactive to infer what the range of is.      Graph of the function .         As we trace points on the interactive in , we see that the -values of points on the graph of appear to assume all values with the exception of and , suggesting that the domain of is . We confirm this algebraically by first noting that the expression is undefined exactly when . Now solve this equation: . (We review in more detail how to solve equations like in .) We conlude that is defined as long as and thus that , as claimed.    Tracing points in the interactive, we observe that for points in the left- and right-most portions of the graph, the -values of points assume all values except . (As we move points to the left or right indefinitely, the graph gets very close to the -axis, but never quite touches it.) On the other hand, for points in the middle section of the graph (between the lines and ), the -values appear to range freely over the interval . We infer from these two observations that .         Vertical Line Test  The graph of a function is a special example of a more general concept, the graph of an equation , which we now define.   Graph of equation   Consider an arbitrary equation , where is a mathematical expression in the unknowns  and , and is a fixed constant. A solution to is a pair such that evaluating the expression at and yields the true equation . The graph of an equation like is the set of all solutions to this equation: , .    Let's consider the equation as an example. Let's first try and produce a few solutions to this equation by hand. One trick that often comes in handy is to set one of the variables equal to zero and see what the other variable must be to produce a solution. Setting in reduces the equation to , which implies that . We conclude that and are solutions to . Similarly, setting gives rise to the solutions and . In all, we have managed to produce a set of four solutions to the equation: . This is far from the set of all solutions however. Indeed, observe that for each assignment with the expression is nonnegative, and hence we can solve as . This means for each , the pairs is a solution to , as is the pair . This yields infinitely many solutions to : two for each choice of . For example, setting in the expressions above yields the solutions and .  We can use technology to produce a detailed graph of . Alternatively, you might recognize this equation as defining a certain circle centered at the origin. (Don't worry if you didn't catch this! We will review such special equations in much more detail later.) Below we provide this graph, along with the few points we managed to produce by hand.   Graph of the equation   Plot of circle of radius 4     The graph of equation displayed in is similar in nature to the examples in the previous subsection. In particular, all of these graphs are curves of some sort in . One explanation of this similarity is that a graph of a function is just a specific example of a graph of an equation . Indeed, given function , its graph is just the graph of the equation (with the restriction that -values of solutions must lie in ). So are there any differences between graphs of functions and graphs of curves more generally? Yes! The defining property of a function is that for each input of a function , there is exactly one input\/output pair on the graph of . Graphically, this means that for each point on the -axis, there is at most one point on the graph of with -coordinate equal to : equivalently, there is at most one point of the graph of lying on the line . This simple observation is the essence of the vertical line text .   Vertical line test   Let be a set of points in .  If for all , the vertical line intersects in at most one point , then is the graph of a function.  Conversely, if there is any vertical line that intersects at more than one point , then is not the graph of a function.    The quantifiers for all and there is appearing in are very important. To clarify their role in the statement of the theorem, let's introduce some additional terminology. Given a vertical line , let's say that a set  passes the -test if intersects in at most one point; similarly, we will say  fails the -test if intersects in more than one point. In terms of this new language, we see that the vertical line test asserts that is the graph of a function if it passes the -test for all vertical lines in ; and conversely, is not the graph of a function if fails the -test for some vertical line in .  Let's see how this plays out with the graph of equation . As illustrated in , there are three qualitatively different ways in which a given vertical line can intersect with .   If the line lies strictly to the left or right of , then does not intersect with at all, and hence passes the -test.    If the line is one of the two vertical lines or , then intersects in exactly one point, and hence passes the -test.    Lastly, if lies strictly between the lines and , then intersects in exactly two points, and thus fails the -test.   Since fails the -test with respect to some vertical line ( , the line ), we conclude by that is not the graph of a function.   Vertical line test:   Vertical line test applied to circle      Vertical line test  It might be helpful to envision the vertical line test as a scanning procedure. Imagine scanning your set with a device that produces a vertical green line that we move from left to right across the entire expanse of .   If at some moment while we are scanning from left to right our green vertical line hits two or more different points on the graph, then our scanner emits a loud error beep, indicating that has failed an -test, and declares that is not the graph of a function.    If, on the other hand, we are able to scan the entire expanse of from left to right without hearing the error beep, then has passed the -test for all vertical lines , and the scanner declares that is the graph of a function.      By way of illustration we apply the vertical line test to a set already known to be the graph of a function.   Vertical line test: radical function   Let and let be the graph of , as depicted in .   Suppose the line has equation , where . How many points lie in the intersection of and . Does pass the -test for this line ?    Suppose the line has equation with . How many points lie in the intersection of and . Does pass the -test in for this line ?    What do (1) and (2) imply in regards to passing the vertical line test or not? Explain.          Graphically, for such lines , we see that intersects in exactly one point. In more detail, if has equation with , then intersects at the point . We conclude that passes the -test for such a line .    If has equation with , then we see graphically that does not intersect at all, and hence passes the -test.    Since the lines discussed in (1) and (2) cover all possible lines in , and since we saw that passes the -test for all these lines , we conclude by vertical line test that is the graph of a function.        Vertical line test: no intersection  Students are sometimes perplexed that if a vertical line does not intersect , then still passes the -test. is helpful in clearing up this confusion. There we see that the lines with equation that do not intersect are precisely those for which , the domain of . The observation holds more generally: if is the graph of a function , then a line with equation intersects in exactly one point if and does not intersect at all for if . This is because only contains points of the form , where .     Functions and relations  Yet another way of interpreting a function is as a binary relation (or just relation, for short). Loosely speaking, a binary relation is a property that either holds ( , is true) or does not hold ( , is not true) for a given pair of elements . When the property holds for we write . A familiar example of a binary relation from mathematics is furnished by the less than relation: we define to mean the real number is less than the real number , denoted in mathematical notation. For an example outside of mathematics, consider the binary relation defined as is a cousin of . In this case is true exactly when persons and are cousins.  A function gives rise to a binary relation in a natural way: namely, we can define the relation as is the value of at (or , for short). For example, the function defined as gives rise to the relation defined as , or in plainer English, is the square of . For example, in this case is true, since is the square of ( , ), but is not true since is not the square of ( , ).  Thus, we see that every function can be thought of as a certain binary relation. As with the situation with graphs of equations, however, not every relation arises from a function in this way. What makes relations arising from functions special is the defining property of a function: namely, that for every input of a function , there is exactly one output . As a consequence a relation is of the form for some function if and only if for every there is at most one such that is true. This is just a logical analogue of the vertical line test!  We will say that a relation  defines as a function of if there is a function such that is true if and only if is in the domain of and . From our discussion above, it follows that a relation defines as a function of if and only if for every there is at most one such that is true.  Consider again the relation defined as is a cousin of . This relation does not define as a function of since it is possible for a person to have more than one cousin.   Relations and functions   Decide whether the given relation defines as a function of .    is defined as is a square root of . (Here and are assumed to range over .)     is defined as is a nonnegative square root of . (Here and are assumed to range over .)     is defined as is the phone number of . (Here ranges over humans, and ranges over all possible phone numbers.)     is defined as is the phone number of . (Here ranges over all possible phone numbers, and ranges over all humans.)          Note that both and are true, since and are both square roots of . Thus it is not the case that for all there is at most one such that is true. We conclude that this relation does not define as a function of .    In this case the relation does define as a function of . This is because for each real number there is at most one nonnegative square root. More explicitly, defining , we see that is true if and only if .    The given relation does not define as a function of for the simple reason that a person can have more than one phone number!    The answer here is perhaps somewhat debatable. If we agree that a given phone number can belong to at most one person, then arises from the function defined as follows: given a (registered) phone number , is the owner of phone number .  Why is this debatable? Well, for one thing, in the era before mobile phones, households were equipped with a single phone (called a land line ), and the case could be made that that number was owned by all the people in the household. Thus, if we want to make a function out of this example, we would have to take more care to define what it means for a phone number to belong to a user.  This discussion is meant to be amusing, but is not entirely idle. It is often the case that a proposed function turns out upon closer inspection to not be well defined. Indeed, something very similar went wrong with the proposed function in .         Modeling with functions  Now that we have taken our first confident strides down the path of function exploration, you may be wondering why the study of functions is so important in the first place. The short answer is that functions are one of the most fundamental tools for modeling empirical phenomena. Scientific inquiry will often begin by treating one empirical quantity as being determined or dependent on some other empirical quantity (or even multiple quantities in a multivariable model ). In this situation it is natural to model the quantity as a function of these other quantities: , we assume there is a function satisfying (or in a multivariable model). Here are some typical examples.   We can model the vertical velocity of a skydiver in free fall as a function of the time elapsed since the diver jumped from the plane. In this case we assume for some function .    We can model the atmospheric temperature as a function of altitude . In this case we assume for some function .    We can model the yearly sales of a certain product as a function of its price and the yearly amount the producer spends on advertising. In this case we assume for some (multivariable) function .   Observe how in these modeling situations the defining characteristic of a function , that each input has a unique output , captures our intuitive idea of one quantity being dependent on another. Indeed, this is what motivates the language of dependent and independent variables introduced in . leads you through a simplified simulation of how scientists proceed from observations of physical phenomena to a full-fledged mathematical model. You are encouraged to explore that exercise on your own.  In the meantime, we end this first section by giving a preview of what calculus is, and how it plays an important role in empirical modeling. In short, calculus is the science of functions. It provides us powerful tools to study properties of functions. What kind of properties of functions are we interested in determining? Continuing with the empirical modeling context, suppose we are modeling quantity as a function of quantity ( , quantity is dependent on, or determined by quantity ). Here are some natural questions about we are interested in when studying the function that articulates the relation between and .   Maximum\/minimum values  Is there a maximum value of that can be attained? Is there a minumum value? In terms of , we are asking whether has a maximum and\/or minimum value. If it does, we would also like to know which inputs give rise to these maximum and minimum values.    Asymptotic values\/asymptotic behavior  Perhaps does not reach a maximum value. Does it approach some maximum value as varies, without ever attaining that value? Suppose quantity ranges naturally over the set of all nonnegative numbers: how does the output vary as gets infinitely large?    Increasing\/decreasing  How do the values change as we vary ? More specifically, does increase as we increase ? Does decrease as we increase ?    Average\/instantaneous rates of change  Fix a particular value of our quantity , and let be the value of corresponding to that input. How does change as we vary by arbitrarily small amounts about . More specifically, call the average rate of change with respect to as we vary from to . What happens to these average rates of change if we keep fixed, and pick to be arbitrarily close to . Do they approach a well-defined instantaneous rate of change ?   All the questions above can be phrased as questions about the function that models the relation between and , and we will be able to answer all of these questions, using calculus, by the end of this course!    Modeling a draining tank    depicts a water tank in the shape of a circular cone (with tip pointed downward). The height of the tank is 4 meters, and its circular top has a radius of 2 meters. The tank contains an initial quantity of water that steadily drains through a regulated valve at the bottom.   A draining conical tank    Once the draining begins we record at each subsequent minute the measurements of the height (in meters), radius (in meters), and volume (in cubic meters) of the conical body of water remaining in the tank. These are summarized in .   Measurements of a draining water tank     (min)  0  1  2  3  4    (m)  3  2.5  2  1.5  1    (m)  1.5  1.25  1  0.75  1    (m )          It is evident that at any time since the draining has begun, the height, radius, and volume of the remaining water have determinate values. Thus we have well-defined functions , , and that output the height, radius, and volume of the remaining water minutes after draining has begun.   What is an appropriate domain for the functions ? Our table only provides values of the functions for . Does this mean we should set ? (There is not one correct answer here.)    Focus on the measurements of the height of the remaining water. How does the height change with each passing minute? Conjecture a formula for the function .    The table suggests a relation between the height and radius of the remaining water at any given time. Express this as an equation involving and . Assuming your conjectured formula for is correct, derive a formula for .    The volume formula for cylinders tells us that .  This conical volume formula is nontrivial, and in fact its derivation requires some sophisticated calculus techniques: techniques you will be equipped with by the end of this course!  Assuming your conjectured formula for is correct, compute a formula for . Assess the accuracy of your formula by comparing its outputs with .    You have now modeled the various quanties associated to the remaining water with the functions . Assess whether your model gives a sensible answer to the following question: what is the volume of the remaining water 10 minutes after the draining has begun? What, in the face of the evidence given by , is a plausible answer to this question. What is a natural way of adjusting your model so that it provides this answer?        "

If, on the other hand, we are able to scan the entire expanse of from left to right without hearing the error beep, then has passed the -test for all vertical lines , and the scanner declares that is the graph of a function.

  "body": " Linear and Quadratic Functions    Functions Linear Functions  Functions Quadratic Functions     Learning Goals    Understand the definition of linear and quadratic functions.    Explore how the parameters of a linear or quadratic function change the shape of its graph and its properties.    Use the different forms for equations for lines.    Solve quadratic equations via factoring or the quadratic formula.      Definitions of linear and quadratic functions   Linear and quadratic functions are important for modeling relationships between many different quantities. For example, in statistics, the method of Linear Regression seeks to find a line that best describes the relationship between quantities that appear to change at a constant rate relative to each other. Quadratic functions are used to model the height of an object falling under the force of gravity. We will explore several models that use linear and quadratic functions in after we develop our mathematical understanding of them.  We begin with the mathematical definitions of linear and quadratic functions. Recall that a mathematical definition is \"used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not.\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Definition accessed August 4, 2022. Thus the definitions below give us the precise meaning of a linear or quadratic function. Remember that we generally need a few examples to make sense of definitions, and these follow below each of the definitions.   Linear Functions   A linear function is a function that can be written in the form for some real numbers and . Alternately, a linear function can be written as a linear equation  , where is a dependent variable of the independent variable .     Examples of linear functions   Below are three examples of linear functions.   The equation defines as a linear function of , taking and in Definition     The equation also defines as a linear function of if we rewrite it as so that we see that we must take and . This function, is a special function, called the identity function , where the output and input are the same.    The equation is also a linear equation, so defines as a linear function (the independent variable isn't specified, though we can infer it to be ). To see this, rewrite it as so that we can see that we must take and . is an example of a constant function , which is a function of the form . For any input, the output is always , meaning the output is a constant number.       An important detail of the above definition is that a linear function can be rewritten in the form ; it may not look like that originally.    Rewrite in the form and identify and . These are two more examples of linear functions.     Quadratic Function   A quadratic function is one that may be written in the form , where , and are real numbers with . Alternately, a quadratic function can be written as a quadratic equation  , where is a dependent variable of the independent variable .    Similar to linear functions, quadratic functions can be written in the form but do not need to begin that way.    Rewrite each of the expressions below in the form and identify , and . These are examples of quadratic functions.                       Parameters  It is important to note that when we write an expression like or , only and are variables. The extra letters , and that are not variables are called parameters of the function. How should you think about these parameters and what they represent?  While the word parameter may be new to you, the concept is probably not so unfamiliar. We can think of a parameter as a \"dial\" on the function machine. Setting the dials to different values creates different functions. Analogy and Image from https:\/\/mathinsight.org\/function_machine_parameters     Think of a function as a machine that turns inputs into outputs. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\\textwidth} \\caption{Parameters are \"dials\" that adjust how the function machine works.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption   Parameters of Linear Functions   Consider the linear function:   Here is the independent variable and is the dependent variable. The letters and are parameters of the linear equation.   If we choose a specific value of and (\"set the dials\"), we get a specific line. For example, if and we get the linear function .    When we change the dials, we get a different line.       When we have a function with parameters , we can think of this function representing a whole family of functions, one for each combination of parameter values.    To get a hands-on feel for this, go to the Desmos site  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/uo5qirntxg . You'll see the equation in the top left and below that, sliders for and (these are our parameters ). The graph is currently set for and .   Play around with the values of and . What happens to the graph? What does each parameter represent in this example?    Can you find values of that represents a horizontal line? Can you find values of that represents a vertical line? If so, what are they? If not, why not?        Parameters of Quadratic Functions   Consider the quadratic equation , where . Graphically, this describes a family of parabolas.   shows a graph of some members of this family. This graph shows parabolas with ; and and parabolas with ; and    for different values of the parameters , and .

What do the members of the family of parametric functions have in common? How do they differ? Which parameter seems to have the simplest effect? Which parameter seems to have the most complicated effect?       Properties of Functions  The table that follows gives us vocabulary and precise mathematical definitions for various types of graphical behavior. Rows 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 describe behaviors that a function could exhibit at a specific point. Rows 3, 4, and 7 describe graphical behaviors that occur over an interval of real numbers.    uses as the independent variable and as the dependent variable. The notation is used to indicate particular values of and . We are using these instead of other letters because we have been using other letters to indicate parameters. A subscript is called an \"index\" (plural \"indices\"). The benefit to using these is that it is easier to keep track of whether they represent a value of the independent variable (for example, or ) or the dependent variable (for example, or ).    Properties of functions in terms of the behavior of their graphs    \\toprule  Vocabulary  Definition  Behavior    \\midrule 1.  has a -intercept or zero at   graph intersects the -axis at          2.  has a -intercept at   graph intersects the -axis at          3.  is positive on  for all  graph is above the -axis on          4.  is increasing on  for all in  graph moves up as we look from left to right on    \\midrule 5.  has a local maximum at  for all near  graph has a relative \"hilltop\" at          6.  has a global maximum at  for all  graph is the highest at          7.  is concave up on  values of grow at a faster and faster rate as increases on  graph curves upwards on like part of a \"U\"          8.  has an inflection point at  and the concavity of changes at  graph of changes from curving upward to curving downward, or vice versa, at    \\bottomrule     There are similar definitions for negative, decreasing, and concave down behavior, as well as local and global minima.  Notice that we describe extrema (maxima and minima) by where on the -axis they occur, since we can always find the corresponding -values from these -values. The concept of \"near\" in the description of a local maximum will be made more precise in Chapters 2 and 3. Inflection points and concavity cannot be precisely defined until we learn about derivatives in Chapter 3. In that chapter we will also learn ways for algebraically calculating the locations of extrema and inflection points. For now we present them just to set terminology and to familiarize ourselves with various types of function behavior; we will have to be content with examining such things graphically.    The -intercepts of are where , so at the values of with . Solving for :   So we see that has an -intercept at .  View a graph of via https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/uo5qirntxg and set the sliders to . From this we see that is positive (above the -axis) for and negative (below the -axis) for . The graph also tells us that is decreasing for , meaning for all values of .  The graph of has no local or global maxima or minima. This is true of all linear functions: none of them have any local or global extrema. Similarly, since the graphs of linear functions are lines, they are neither concave up nor concave down and do not have any inflection points.      The list that follows at the right describes each of the properties in the table above of the graph shown on the left.  \\fbox{ Use this example to check your understanding of each of the properties, going back and forth between and to identify each feature.}     Conjecture   A mathematical conjecture is \"is a conclusion or a proposition that is proffered on a tentative basis without proof.\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conjecture accessed August 5, 2022   Use the Desmos graph at  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/yayrd6etuz  and set the parameters to , and to graph the function .

Determine the locations of any local and global extrema (minima or maxima) of . Conjecture: Do all quadratic functions have local\/global extrema?    Determine the intervals on which is concave up\/down. Are there any inflection points (where the concavity changes)? Conjecture: Play with the parameters , and and determine which parameter controls the concavity of a quadratic function.        Finding a \"good\" graphing window   Since we are using graphs to determine the properties of functions (for now), we should be especially careful that we can create a \"good\" graph of a function, meaning a graph that captures all of the key features and properties of the graph.  Here, we demonstrate finding a \"good\" graphing window for the graph of the function .  The three graphs that follow show in various graphing windows. Each of these windows is \"bad\" in the sense that the true behavior of the graph of is not represented.   Three \"bad\" graphing windows for . The properties of the graph are not accurately represented.    A \"good\" window (if one exists) is a window in which the local behavior of the graph of is clear and the global behavior is accurately represented (the \"ends\" of the graph keep going in the direction indicated). The following figure shows the graph of in a \"good\" window:   A \"good\" graphing windows for . The properties of the graph are accurately represented.    For now we will use trial and error to find an effective graphing window. Later, we will learn algebraic methods for determining all of these properties.      Different Equations of Lines  A line in the plane is completely described by its slope and -intercept . You could tell someone the values of and in a text message and they would know exactly which line you were referring to, without needing to attach a picture. We can also describe a line in the plane with its slope and the coordinates of any point on the line, or with the coordinates of any two points on the line. This last is how Euclid's Elements begin to develop geometry. Book I Postulate 1 states that given any two points, there is a line that joins them. https:\/\/mathcs.clarku.edu\/ djoyce\/elements\/bookI\/post1.html accessed August 17, 2022.   These three ways of describing lines give us three forms of equations for lines found in : slope-intercept form , point-slope form , and two-point form . Note that here we are again using indices to represent different values of the variables and . , and represent values of the independent variable , while , and represent values of the dependent variable .   Three forms for the equation of a line    \\toprule Name of form  Information given  Equation of line    \\midrule slope-intercept form  slope , -intercept          point-slope form  slope and any point on the line          two-point form  any two points and on the line  or    \\bottomrule     There is an advantage to slope-intercept form in that we can tell from looking at any two functions in that form whether they represent the same line. However, the other forms are sometimes easier to use based on our given information.  Let's explore the point-slope and two-point forms a bit more. The slope of a line can be interpreted as how much the line \"rises\" (increases or decreases) given a \"run\" of one unit increase in . Thus the slope can be calculated by the formula \\fbox{ } for any two points and on the line. From this we see that the two-point form of the equation of a line is the same as the point-slope form, as long as we calculate the slope from the two points ahead of time. Note that when we do that, we may use either point or to determine the equation, but we must stick with one or the other.   Finding equations of lines   Find equations for each of the linear functions described. Two lines are said to be parallel if they have the same slopes, and perpendicular if their slopes, and , are negative reciprocals of each other (meaning that or vice versa).   The line with slope that passes through the point , in slope-intercept form.    The line that passes through the points and , in slope-intercept form.    The line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line , in slope-intercept form.          Using the point-slope formula with slope and point , we get the equation . To put this equation into slope-intercept form, we just simplify: (The symbol used in the calculation above denotes that the equality to the left of the symbol logically implies the equality to the right of the symbol.)    The slope of the line through the points and is . Using this slope, the point , and the two-point formula, we get Using the point will give you the same equation in slope-intercept form after simplifying. Try it!    The line we are looking for is perpendicular to and thus has slope . Using the point-slope form with slope and point , we obtain . In slope-intercept form the equation is written .        Checking the Answer   To verify that the three linear functions we just found are reasonable, we can graph them with a graphing utility (such as Desmos). In particular, let's graph the lines (red) and (green) in part c to make sure they appear to be perpendicular:     Notice that the scales on the - and -axes are the same, so the lines correctly appear as perpendicular. Additionally, we can see that the point is on the line .      Find an equation for the line passing through that is parallel to the line . Write your answer first in point-slope form and then in slope-intercept form.      Finding -intercepts of Quadratic Functions  In this section, we develop algebraic methods for finding the -intercepts of quadratic functions. This is where the graph of the function crosses the -axis. As we can see in Figure , by shifting the graph of a quadratic function vertically, we can make its graph cross the -axis 0 times (as in the graph labeled ), exactly 1 time ( as in the graph labeled ), or twice (as in the graph labeled ). These points are the -intercepts, sometimes referred to as zeros of the graph, because these are the points where the quadratic function is equal to 0.   Three examples of quadratic functions that open up.    If we want to find the zeros of a quadratic equation, we must find the values of that make the quadratic function equal to zero, meaning we must solve solve the quadratic equation  for the variable . Some quadratic equations can be solved easily by factoring the quadratic expression . To factor an algebraic expression, you write that expression as a product of simpler expressions. There are a few different common methods for factoring that we will discuss here:    For example, the expression can be factored by recognizing that both terms share common factors of 3 and that can be un-distributed from the expression:   We can think of this factoring as \"reverse distributing.\"    Some quadratic expressions can be factored by doing the \"FOIL\" (\"First-Outside-Inside-Last\") method backwards:    For example, the expression can be factored as . Breaking this down, observe that the first terms in both and are and multiply to the . The outside terms and multiply to while the inside terms and multiply to , and that these can be added together to get . The last terms and multiply to .  Here is a good Purplemath article and here is a Khan Academy video on factoring this type of quadratic.      Factor as much as possible by working backwards (\"reverse FOILing\") to find constants and with . You may need to guess-and-check a few times to determine the answer.   Challenge: Factor as much as possible.    Differences of squares can be factored with the use of the following formula:   Formulas for Factoring Differences of Squares   For all real numbers and ,       The expression can be rewritten as , which is the difference of the square of and the square of . Thus the quadratic expression can be factored as .    There are more formulas for factoring differences of higher powers, but we won't introduce them here.  The reason that factoring can help solve an equation is that a basic property of the real numbers is that a product can be equal to zero only if one of the factors in the product is zero. In the following theorem we use the term real expressions, which will denote any expressions that when calculated are real numbers.   A Product Is Zero If and Only If One of the Factors Is Zero   For any real expressions and , if and only if or .      Returning to from Example , the real expression is a product of the real expressions and . when whereas when , and so the product when either  or .  Thus the quadratic function has zeros at and . Use the Desmos graph at  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/yayrd6etuz  to verify that crosses the -axis at and .      We can solve the quadratic equation via factoring the difference of squares as before and setting each factor equal to 0:   Thus the function has -intercepts at .     If you try to solve by adding 4 to both sides and taking the square root of both sides, you may think that there is only one solution when . For this reason, factoring is a more reliable method for solving this type of equation! We will explore why exactly we get the positive and negative square root of 4 as the solutions to in Section 1.7.   The phrase \"if and only if\" in Theorem is shorthand for saying that the implication goes both ways. The forward direction of this implication says that if is zero, then either or (or both) is zero. the backwards direction says that if or is zero, then is also zero. This theorem can be generalized to products involving more than two factors; for example, a product if and only if one or more of the factors , , , and is zero.   Warning!  Theorem applies only to equations that are set to zero, that is, equations of the form . Theorem does not say, for example, that if and only if or .    To find the solutions of the equation , we CANNOT factor the left-hand side and then set each factor equal to a divisor of . For example, the following calculation is INCORRECT:   However, when , , and when , .  The correct method is to first subtract the 4 from both sides so that the right side is 0, and then factor the left-hand side:   You should check that when either or by plugging in those values and simplifying.    Unfortunately, some quadratic expressions, such as , are not so easy to factor. If we wish to find the -values that satisfy the quadratic equation without factoring, we can apply the quadratic formula to determine the solutions.   The Quadratic Formula   If , and are real numbers, the solutions of the quadratic equation are of the form      Deriving the quadratic formula involves a process called \"completing the square\" that we aren't going to get into, but here's a good video on deriving this formula, in case you are interested.     Applying the quadratic formula to the equation , we have , , and , so the solutions are and so the quadratic function has two roots at and at . Once again, you should verify this using this Desmos graph .    The expression is called the discriminant , and it determines the number of solutions of the quadratic equation .   If is positive, then there will be two solutions: one when the symbol is a plus and one when it is a minus.    If is zero, then there is only one solution, namely, .    If is negative, then its square root is not a real number and thus the equation has no real solutions. In this case the equation does have complex-number solutions, but in this book we will be concerned only with real numbers, so a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant will be said to have \"no solutions.\"       Find the zeros (if there are any) of the quadratic functions below, either by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Use a graph to check your answers.                            Summary  The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section: linear function, linear equation, identity function, constant function, quadratic function, quadratic equation, parameter, function with parameter; -intercept, zero of a function, -intercept, positive (and negative), increasing (and decreasing), local maximum (and minimum), global maximum (and minimum), concave up (and concave down), inflection point; extrema, conjecture; slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and two-point form of a line; parallel, perpendicular; real expressions, difference of squares, quadratic formula, discriminant  Key ideas: Linear and quadratic functions can be written in the forms and , respectively, for particular values of the parameters , and . There are alternate forms for the equations of a line that can be useful. There are many methods for factoring quadratic equations and finding the -intercepts of a quadratic function, including using the Quadratic Formula.   Other ideas introduced: Families of functions can have similar properties that change depending on the values of the parameters of the function. We wish to develop algebraic methods for determining the properties of functions so we do not have to rely on computer-generated graphs.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.2}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

Visualize average rate of change on the graph of a function.    See how the idea of average rate of change can be useful in some applied contexts.    Understand the units for average rate of change in the context of a mathematical model.    Compare the average rate of change of a linear function and a quadratic function.    Revisit the idea of concavity in terms of average rate of change.      Definition of Average Rate of Change of a Function  In the previous section, we looked at linear and quadratic functions in some depth. We now know that each type of function has a predictable shape. In particular, linear function have a constant slope, while quadratic functions do not. Another way to say this is that linear functions change at a constant rate. In this section, we learn one way to describe how functions change when they do not increase or decrease at a constant rate.     below shows the height of the winning pole vault at the Olympics  The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 2005 ,p. 866 (New York). As found in Applied Calculus by Hughes Hallet et al. during the 1960s and more recently. Find the rate of change of the winning height between 1960 and 1968, and between 2008 and 2016. In which of these two periods did the height increase faster?   Winning height in men's Olympic pole vault (approximate)    \\toprule Year  1960  1964  1968  \\ldots  2008  2012  2016    \\midrule Height (cm)  470  510  540  \\ldots  596  597  603    \\bottomrule       To compare the 1960s and the more recent period, we calculate the average change over each time period, similar to how we calculate the slope of a line as :    Thus, on average, the height was increasing more quickly during the 1960s.    The data in does not have a constant rate of change (it is not linear). However, we can compute an average rate of change over any interval. The word average is used because the rate of change may vary within the interval.  In general, given a function that models a certain phenomenon, it's natural to ask such questions as \"how is the function changing on a given interval\" or \"on which interval is the function changing more rapidly?\" The concept of average rate of change enables us to make these questions more mathematically precise.  We use the symbol (the Greek letter capital delta) to mean \"change in,\" so means \"change in and means \"change in y.\" The average rate of change of a dependent quantity is then expressed as a fraction of the change in the dependent variable divided by the amount of change in the independent variable:   Average Rate of Change   If is a function of , so , then . The units of average rate of change of a function are units of per units of .  We will often abbreviate the average rate of change on the interval as     The quantity is called a difference quotient because it is the quotient of two differences. This formula may look familiar to you; it resembles the formula we use in to compute the slope of the line between two points. As we will explore later, the average rate of change of a function on an interval can be visualized as the slope of the line from to .    For example, the function graphed below in is increasing until , decreasing from to , increasing again from until , and then decreasing after .   A function that both increases and decreases.    The function is not linear and so has no \"slope.\" In order to discuss how much it increases or decreases, we can look at each interval separately.  On the interval , we calculate the average rate of change of between and . First, we observe that and in order to use these quantities in the formula for Average Rate of Change with and : and so we see that, on average, the function is changing by units of per unit of between and . We could also say that the function is decreasing by 2 units of per unit of , which matches what we see in the picture.  Similarly, we calculate the average rate of change of on the interval . Observe that and will be used in the formula for Average Rate of Change, using and : so, on average, the function is increasing by 1 unit of per unit of between and .  We can also measure average rate of change over intervals where the function both increases and decreases. For example, on the interval the function first decreases and then increases. Note that and . Computing the average rate of change from to : so, on average, the function is decreasing by 1 (or changing by ) unit of per unit of between and .  As another example, the average rate of change on the interval is where we observe that since and , the function has not changed on average from to .      What is another interval where the function pictured above in has an average rate of change of 0?      Average Change of a Linear Function  Let's examine the average change of linear functions using the function . Before we begin and without doing any calculations, think about what the average change of a line should be.  Now let's compute the average change of on three different, random intervals: , , and . Before reading the calculations below, you should evaluate the values of at each of the endpoints of the intervals ( , and ) to make following it less confusing. .    We notice that we have gotten the same average change of for all three intervals. We wonder if this is a coincidence. In order to confirm that this is not a coincidence, we calculate the average change of on any interval :   So now we have confirmed that the average rate of change of on any interval is , which is the same as the slope .  There was nothing special about this function. The average change of any linear function on any interval is the slope of the function. In fact, we may take this to be the definition of a linear function, if we want:   Alternate Definition of a Linear Function   A function is linear provided that its average rate of change is constant on every choice of interval in its domain.      Let be given by the data in the table     Determine , and for the function . Could be a linear function?      Visualizing Average Rate of Change  So far we have practiced using the formula for average rate of change from a graph, function, and table. We also established that the average rate of change of a line is its slope. In this section, we connect these two ideas: \\fbox{The average rate of change of a function on an interval can be visualized as the slope of the line between the points and . }  Visualizing Average Rate of Change as Slope   Calculate the average rate of change of the function (a) on the interval and (b) on the interval . Then (c) illustrate these average rates of change graphically.       To find the average change on , first we compute and . Now using the formula, we have .    To find the average change on , let's first compute that and . Using the formula again, we have .    Graphically, the two average rates we found can be represented as slopes of line segments, as follows:  The slope between and is 2. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\caption{The slope between and is .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{The average rate of change can be visualized as slope.}          Copy the graph from Example on to your paper and visualize the average change on , and as the slope of the line between the endpoints of each interval (one line for each interval). Make sure these appear to be reasonable based on the calculated average rates of change in Example .   The graph from Example \\xautoref{ex_avgchange1}.        Average Change in Context  Let's now return to the question of describing the rate of change of a quantity in context, paying special attention to the units and interpretation for these calculations.    Let the height function for a ball tossed vertically be given by , where is measured in seconds since the ball was thrown and is measured in feet above the ground.  Plotting the function using Desmos in , it looks like the ball is thrown from a height of 48 feet, reaches its maximum height of 64 feet after 1 second, and hits the ground after 3 seconds:   The function graphed with key points labeled.    The average rate of change of on the interval is calculated below, using the fact that and :   According to Definition , the units for the average rate of change of should be \"units of per units of .\" Since the units of are feet and the units of are seconds, the units for are \"feet per second.\" In the context of the ball, this means that from 1.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds after the ball is thrown, it falls at an average speed of 32 feet per second toward the ground.  We can visualize the quantity as the slope of the line connecting the points and on the graph of :       In the context of a function that measures height or position of a moving object at a given time, such as in Example , the meaning of the average rate of change of the function on a given interval is the average velocity of the moving object because it is the ratio of change in position to change in time:   For example, in Exercise , the units on are \"feet per second\" since the units on the numerator are \"feet\" and on the denominator \"seconds.\" The fact that the average rate of change is negative in this example indicates that the ball is falling. In every situation, the units on the average rate of change help us interpret its meaning, and those units are always \"units of output per unit of input.\"  Here is another context in which we consider an average rate of change:    According to the US census, the populations of Kent and Ottawa Counties in Michigan from 1960 to 2010, measured in -year intervals are given in the following tables.  Kent County population data.   Ottawa county population data.   Let represent the population of Kent County in year and the population of Ottawa County in year .   Compute for both and .    What are the units on each of the quantities you computed in part a?    Write a careful sentence that explains the meaning of the average rate of change of the Ottawa county population on the time interval . Your sentence should begin something like ``In an average year between 1990 and 2010, the population of Ottawa County was ...\"    Which county had a greater average rate of change during the time interval ? Were there any intervals in which one of the counties had a negative average rate of change?    Using the given data, what do you predict will be the population of Ottawa County in 2018? Why?       If you have time, attempt the questions yourself, then read the solutions below.   For , we have . For , we have .    Population is measured in people, time here is measured in years. So, the units are people per year.    In an average year between 1990 and 2010, the population of Ottawa County was increasing by about people per year.    Between 2000 and 2010, the Kent County population increased by about people per year, and the Ottawa County population increased by about people per year. So, Kent county had a greater average rate of change. Since the populations always increase from one decade to the next, neither county has an interval with a negative average rate of change.    The average rate of change between and in Ottawa county is people per year; if we assume this holds over the next years, then in the total population will be: people years people per year people.       The average rate of change of a function on an interval gives us an excellent way to describe how the function behaves, on average. For instance, if we compute for Kent County, we find that , which tells us that in an average year from 1970 to 2000, the population of Kent County increased by about 5443 people. Said differently, we could also say that from 1970 to 2000, Kent County was growing at an average rate of 5443 people per year. These ideas also afford the opportunity to make comparisons over time. Since , we can not only say that Kent County's population increased by about 7370 in an average year between 1990 and 2000, but also that the population was growing faster from 1990 to 2000 than it did from 1970 to 2000.  Finally, we can even use the average rate of change of a function to predict future behavior. Since the population was changing on average by 7370.5 people per year from 1990 to 2000, we can estimate that the population in 2002 is .  This of course assumes that the average increase in population during the next two years remains the same as it has been in the past 10 years.    Concavity and Average Change of a Quadratic Function  In contrast to linear functions, quadratic functions do not have a constant rate of change. Instead, their rates of change follow a different pattern. We'll begin to see this pattern by looking at the graphs of functions whose rates of change are increasing throughout an interval or decreasing throughout an interval.   below shows graphs that are concave up: they are bending upward because the rate of change of the function is increasing.   An increasing, concave up function. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\caption{A decreasing, concave up function.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Graphs that are concave up. Their rates of change are increasing.}  On the other hand, below shows graphs that are concave down: they are bending downward because the rate of change of the function is decreasing.   An increasing, concave down function. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\caption{A decreasing, concave down function.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Graphs that are concave down. Their rates of change are decreasing.}  We know that quadratic functions are always either concave up or concave down, so we can expect their rates of change to increase (if the quadratic function in concave up) or for them to decrease (if the quadratic function is concave down). Note that a line is neither concave up nor concave down, and its rate of change is constant.  Here is an example in the context of a falling object to help us look even further into what pattern rates of change of quadratic functions follow:    Suppose a water balloon is tossed vertically from a fifth story window. Its height, , in meters, at time , in seconds, is modeled by the function .  Below is a table for values of average rates of change for on select intervals. Can you spot a pattern?   Average rates of change for on several unit-length intervals        \\midrule  m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     In Table we see an interesting pattern in the average velocities of the ball: they decrease by exactly 10 m\/s on each subsequent unit-length interval. Indeed, if we remove the endpoint of each interval and focus on the starting value of each interval, viewing the resulting average rate of change as a function of the starting value, we may consider the related table, Table seen below:   Data from Table , recast with average velocity as a function of the starting point of the interval        \\midrule  m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     We observe that the average rate of change of is decreasing by 10 m\/s for each second that passes. It is itself changing in a way that seems to be represented by a linear function. Thus it appears that the average rate of change is a linear function of . Moreover, we can also visualize the concave down quadratic function and its decreasing average rates of change. The picture below graphs these average rates of change as slope on each interval, and we can see that the slopes of the lines on each interval are getting more and more negative (from to , then , etc.).       While it takes key ideas from calculus to formalize this observation, for now we will simply note that for a quadratic function, there seems to be a related linear function that tells us something about how the quadratic function changes.    Summarize the difference between average rates of change for linear and quadratic functions.      Summary  The following terms, symbols, and formulas were introduced in this section:  meaning \"change in,\" average rate of change of a function on an interval, difference quotient, average velocity.  Key ideas: The average rate of change of a function on an intervals describes how much, on average, that function is increasing or decreasing on the interval. Linear functions have constant average rate of change. Quadratic functions do not have a constant average rate of change. Average rate of change can be visualized as slope between points on the graph. The units for average rate of change are units of output per unit of input.   Other ideas introduced: Functions that are concave up have increasing rates of change while functions that are concave down have decreasing rates of change. Quadratic functions have rates of change that appear to be changing linearly.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.3}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "body": " Modeling with Linear and Quadratic Functions    Functions Modeling     Learning Goals    Examine the mathematical modeling cycle.    Use linear and quadratic functions to describe real-world problems.    Practice translating back and forth between the context and mathematical calculations in a problem.    Revisit ideas of domain and range, increasing and decreasing, intercepts, and average rate of change in a context that gives these concepts a practical meaning.      The Mathematical Modeling Process  A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.   below illustrates the process of mathematical modeling.   The modeling cycle. Graphic from www.educationaldesigner.org .    Given a real-world problem, our first task is to formulate a mathematical problem by   identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables    making assumptions that simplify the problem so it is easy enough to describe with mathematics    using knowledge of the physical situation to brainstorm relevant equations, formulas, and theorems, possibly working from data or a graph    obtaining equations that relate the variables     The second step is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that we will be developing over the year) to the mathematical equations that we have formulated in order to derive a mathematical solution.  In the third step, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don't compare well with reality, we need to refine our model or formulate a new model and start the cycle over again.  This is similar to the framework for problem-solving described in , except that in a truly real-world problem, the actual question may not be stated explicitly or formulated in a way that can be answered without further refinement of the question (getting more information, simplifying more assumptions, building more theory). Since we are working in the context of a calculus course, all of our \"real-world\" questions will be very well-behaved and tractable.  A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation. Instead, it is an idealization or an approximation . A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to realize the limitations of the model.    Using Linear Functions as Models  Since linear functions have a constant slope, linear functions perfectly model quantities that change at a constant rate. In context, we can often think of slope as a rate of change. Paying careful attention to units can help determine whether given information is a value of a variable or a rate of change.   Dolbear's Law   One example of a mathematical model is found in Dolbear's Law. You can read more in the Wikipedia entry for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets. For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see this article . In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature. If we let represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.   Data for Dolbear's observations    \\toprule (chirps per minute)  40  80  120  160    \\midrule ( Fahrenheit)        \\bottomrule     For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. When we graph the data, we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use:   Graph of Dolbear's data and the underlying curve.    The data appear to fit a line. If we calculate the average rate of change between any two points, this should give us the slope of the line. Using the points and , we find .  Using point-slope form with the point You could use the point instead, or any of the other points.  and simplifying to slope-intercept form, we have   Before we attempt any further calculations, we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data. Let's check that the point is indeed on the line. For , we have   Success! Now that we have found a formula, and convinced ourselves that it's correct, If you are not convinced yet, think about how you could further verify that this model is accurate. let's give it a name. Let be the name of our \"Dolbear\" function that takes number of chirps per minute as inputs and gives temperature in degrees Fahrenheit as outputs:  \\fbox{ Dolbear's function, , models the relationship between the number of cricket chirps per minute and the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.}      Now that we have a model for Dolbear's observations, let's use it to make some predictions.   If we hear snowy tree crickets chirping at a rate of 92 chirps per minute, what does Dolbear's model suggest should be the outside temperature?    If the outside temperature is F, how many chirps per minute should we expect to hear?    Suppose that in the morning an observer hears 65 chirps per minute, and several hours later hears 75 chirps per minute. How much has the temperature risen between observations?        More about Dolbear's Law   Let's continue to explore the limits of our model for Dolber's observations. Suppose we wish to know the number of chirps we should hear when the outside temperature is F. There is no point on the graph with and so we solve numerically for to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is F.   So we see that . In context, this means that when it's outside, we should hear chirps per minute. A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense, and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is F.  At this point in the modeling process, a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations. Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above F are too hot for the crickets, so the model is only accurate for temperatures between F and F. What is the fewest number of chirps per minute an observer could expect to hear? The greatest number of chirps per minute?  From the original observations in , we can see that . Using the algebraic function, we can compute so that . Thus we can expect to observe between 40 and 180 chirps per minute for temperatures between F and F. Note that we are using our understanding of the shape of linear functions here: this is an increasing linear function, so the values of the outputs increase steadily with the values of the inputs.     When working with a model, it is common to have to restrict the domain of a function based on real-world conditions, rather than algebraic requirements, so that the model makes sense in the context it is meant to represent.   Here is another physical phenomenon where a linear function provides an appropriate model: measuring the area of a glacier over time. Remember: linear functions have constant average rates of change, so are ideal for modeling quantities that change at a constant rate.   Modeling Glacier Areas   The summit of Africa's largest peak, Mt. Kilimanjaro, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak. Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 ( ) to be approximately m ; in the year 2007, the ice cover measured m .   Suppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year. Find a linear model whose output is the area, in square meters in year (where is the number of years after 2000).    What do the slope and -intercept mean in the model you found in (a)? In particular, what are the units on the slope?    Compute . What does this quantity measure? Write a complete sentence to explain.    If the model holds further into the future, when do we predict the ice cover will vanish?    In light of your work above, what is a reasonable domain to use for the model ? What is the corresponding range?       If you have time, work through the example on your own first, then read the solution below.   We are told that the ice cover starts at , so the point lies on the graph of the function. We are also given the point . The slope is then The linear model is then .    The slope is the rate at which the glacier is losing ice each year, measured in m \/year. The -intercept is the area of the ice at (in 2000).     . In 2017, the ice cover on the glacier is approximately 989.2857 m .    The ice cover will vanish when . Solving for , we have . The ice cover will vanish toward the end of May of 2034.    A reasonable domain for the model is . The corresponding range is , meaning the ice cover will take on values between 1951 m and 0 m . (Note that we still write this interval as 0 to 1951 when using interval notation, even though the ice cover is vanishing.)         What is a quantity or phenomenon that you observe to have a constant rate of change? Assign names to the independent and dependent variables and create a linear model of this phenomenon. If relevant, include an appropriate domain and\/or range. Is your model an increasing or decreasing linear function?      Modeling with Quadratic Functions: Falling Objects  One of the reasons that quadratic functions are so important is because of a physical fact of the universe we inhabit: for an object only being influenced by gravity, acceleration due to gravity is constant . If we measure time in seconds and a rising or falling object's height in feet, the gravitational constant is feet per second per second, where the negative sign signifies that gravity is pulling \"down,\" meaning toward the ground.  One of the fantastic consequences of calculus which, like the realization that acceleration due to gravity is constant, is largely due to Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s is that the height of a falling object at time is modeled by a quadratic function.   Height of an object falling under the force of gravity   For an object tossed vertically from an initial height of feet with a velocity of feet per second, the object's height at time (in seconds) is given by the formula and corresponds to a gravitational constant of ft\/s .  If height is measured instead in meters and velocity in meters per second, the gravitational constant is m\/s and the function has form .    We will see where this formula comes from later in the course!    A water balloon is tossed vertically from a dorm room window at an initial height of 37 feet with an initial velocity of 41 feet per second. We can use Theorem to model the height of the water balloon. First, we notice that since the information is given in feet and seconds, we should use the formula corresponding to a gravitational constant of ft\/s . Next, we determine the constants in the formula. The initial height in the problem is given as 37 feet, so we have .  The initial velocity is given as 41 feet per second. Note the units! This is the rate of change of position. Thus we have .  Thus our model is where is measured in seconds, denotes the time at which the water balloon is thrown, and is measured in feet.  Now that we have our model, let's answer some questions. First, let's determine the time that the water balloon hits the ground. At that time, the height will be 0, so our mathematical task is to solve for , noting that we would like to have a positive time since our model only becomes valid after . That quadratic equation does not look like it will factor nicely, so we will immediately use the quadratic formula:   Since we are looking for a time after the balloon is thrown, the answer we are looking for is   This implies a domain for our model since the balloon cannot pass through the ground: the model gives the height of the water balloon seconds after it is thrown until it hits the ground, so for .  Lastly, let's graph our function and use that to estimate the time the water balloon reaches its highest point, along with its height at that time. This will give us the range of our model, as well.   The function that models the height of the water balloon for .    From the Desmos graph, we can see that the quadratic function reaches its maximum at approximately the point . (We can also check that our model has the correct vertical intercept and that our computation for when the balloon hits the ground is correct.) The range of our model is . Interpreting this information back into the context of the balloon, we can say that the balloon reaches its highest point approximately second after it is thrown, and that its height is feet at that time.     One of our main goals this semester will be to develop algebraic methods with which to answer this last question of when and where a maximum occurs. But we need calculus in order to do that.     Use the model developed in Example to answer the following questions. Recall the formula from Section for the Average Rate of Change of a function on an interval :    Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . What are the units for the number you computed?    Copy the graph of from to your notes. Draw an appropriate line on the graph whose slope is the value of the average rate of change in part (a).    You should have computed in part (a) and be able to see in part (b) that the average rate of change of on the interval is negative. Does this mean that the balloon is falling between and ?    Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . Is the balloon speeding up or slowing down as it approaches the ground?         Cost, Revenue, and Profit  In this section, we look at some of the functions of interest to decision-makers in a firm or industry.   The Cost Function   The cost function , gives the total cost of producing a quantity of some good.    What sort of function do you expect to be? The more goods that are made, the higher the total cost, so is an increasing function. Costs of production can be separated into two parts: the fixed costs, which are incurred even if nothing is produced, and the variable costs, which depend on how many units are produced.    Let's consider a company that makes radios. The factory and machinery needed to begin production are fixed costs, which are incurred even if no radios are made. The costs of labor and raw materials are variable costs since these quantities depend on how many radios are made. The fixed costs for this company are $24,000 and the variable costs are $7 per radio. Then so, if is the number of radios produced, . This is the equation of a line with slope 7 and vertical intercept of 24,000!    The variable cost for one additional unit is called the marginal cost . For a linear cost function, the marginal cost is the rate of change, or slope, of the cost function.    In each case, draw a graph of a linear cost function satisfying the given conditions:   Fixed costs are large but marginal cost is small.    There are no fixed costs but marginal cost is high.        The Revenue Function   The revenue function , , gives the total revenue received by a firm from selling a quantity, of some good.    If the goods sell for a price of per unit, and the quantity sold is , then . If the price does not depend on the quantity sold, so is a constant, the graph of revenue as a function of is a line through the origin, with slope equal to the price .    If radios sell for $15 each, then the manufacturer's revenue function is       Graph the cost function and the revenue function on the same axes. For what values of does the company make money?    The company makes money whenever revenues are greater than costs, so we find the values of for which the graph of lies above the graph of :     We find the point at which the graph of and cross:   The company makes a profit if it produces and sells more than 3000 radios. The company loses money if it produces and sells fewer than 3000 radios.    This difference between the revenue and cost is called profit , and many decisions are made based on this quantity, rather than cost or revenue alone:   The Profit Function   The profit function , written as to distinguish it from the price, , is the difference   The break-even point for a company is the point where the profit is zero and revenue equals cost.      For our radio manufacturer, a formula for the profit function is   Notice that the negative of the fixed cost is the vertical intercept and the break-even point is the horizontal intercept when we graph in :   Profit for the radio manufacturer.        If cost, , and revenue, , are given by the graph below, what is the break-even point for the company? For what production quantities does the firm make a profit?       Just as we used the term marginal cost to mean the rate of change, or slope, of a linear cost function, we use the terms marginal revenue and marginal profit to mean the rate of change, or slope, of linear revenue and profit functions, respectively. The term marginal is used because we are looking at how the cost, revenue, or profit change \"at the margin,\" that is, by the addition of one more unit.    For example, for the radio manufacturer, the marginal cost is 7 dollars\/item (the additional cost of producing one more item is $7), the marginal revenue is 15 dollars\/item (the additional revenue from selling one more item is $15), and the marginal profit is 8 dollars\/item (the additional profit from selling one more item is $8).      How is the idea of a \"marginal\" cost, revenue, or profit similar to the idea of the average rate of change of a function?      Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: mathematical model, height of a falling object, cost function, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, revenue function, profit function, break-even point, marginal revenue, marginal profit.  Key ideas: Linear and quadratic functions are extremely useful for modeling real-world phenomena. Properties of functions and average rate of change have meaningful interpretations in such contexts.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.4}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

You can read more in the Wikipedia entry for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets. For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see this article . In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature. If we let represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.   Data for Dolbear's observations    \\toprule (chirps per minute)  40  80  120  160    \\midrule ( Fahrenheit)        \\bottomrule     For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. When we graph the data, we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use:   Graph of Dolbear's data and the underlying curve.    The data appear to fit a line. If we calculate the average rate of change between any two points, this should give us the slope of the line. Using the points and , we find .  Using point-slope form with the point You could use the point instead, or any of the other points.  and simplifying to slope-intercept form, we have   Before we attempt any further calculations, we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data. Let's check that the point is indeed on the line. For , we have   Success! Now that we have found a formula, and convinced ourselves that it's correct, If you are not convinced yet, think about how you could further verify that this model is accurate. let's give it a name.

There is no point on the graph with and so we solve numerically for to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is F.   So we see that . In context, this means that when it's outside, we should hear chirps per minute. A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense, and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is F.  At this point in the modeling process, a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations. Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above F are too hot for the crickets, so the model is only accurate for temperatures between F and F. What is the fewest number of chirps per minute an observer could expect to hear? The greatest number of chirps per minute?  From the original observations in , we can see that . Using the algebraic function, we can compute so that . Thus we can expect to observe between 40 and 180 chirps per minute for temperatures between F and F. Note that we are using our understanding of the shape of linear functions here: this is an increasing linear function, so the values of the outputs increase steadily with the values of the inputs.
