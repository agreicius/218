  "title": "How to Read Mathematics",
  "body": " How to Read Mathematics   Learning Goals    See suggestions for how to read math, and start thinking about how to implement these to best suit your needs and learning style    Learn how mathematics texts are organized around Definitions, Theorems, and Examples    There are many websites that provide guidance for students on how to read mathematics. Here are a few of them:    https:\/\/www.maa.org\/node\/121566 ,     https:\/\/web.stonehill.edu\/compsci\/History_Math\/math-read.htm ,     https:\/\/www.macalester.edu\/max\/math-econ-119\/howtoread\/ ,     https:\/\/brownmath.com\/stfa\/read.htm , and     https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1A0LT4BeL-J7Sw_jITi0iCwRnvYQut535\/view?usp=sharing      They all provide good advice and the main idea they all emphasize is that reading math (or really any technical writing) is going to take time and require your active involvement in order to understand what is written. However, you only have a limited amount of time in your day and you probably also have a very heavy workload, so you will need to read strategically, as well as actively.  Keep in mind as you read this section that you will need to take these ideas and experiment with them to find a system that works best for you. Just as everyone learns in different ways, everyone has a different way of reading that works best for them. If you have never learned mathematics by reading before, be patient with yourself and expect to improve over time as you adjust to the new format and refine your workflow.    Think about the following questions as you read.   Which of the ideas presented in this section resonate most with you?    Which strategies do you already employ?    What do you think you will start by trying?    How will you know if your reading method is working for you or requires changing?         General \"Do's\" for Reading Math  Here are some bits of general, practical advice to keep in mind while reading a math textbook. Some will work better for you and some will not, but you should keep an open mind about them all. If your methods are not producing the results you want, look through this list again and adopt some new methods that look like they will help with the issues you have identified.    Read multiple times and in multiple ways  You will almost certainly not understand or remember everything after a single reading! Expect to return to your notes and the textbook several times in order to fully grasp the material.    You may wish to skim through quickly first before reading a section in depth. Other people prefer to go through slowly first for details and then reread briefly to get the big picture. Try one or the other, depending on how much time and patience you have at the time.    If you are very confused by the reading before coming to class, return to the textbook after class and reread it to see how your new understanding helps the ideas fit together.    Return to definitions, theorems, formulas, and examples while working through homework problems. In particular, find any examples that seem to solve a similar problem.    \\text{ Do not } read through the textbook as a way to study for exams unless you have a specific purpose in doing so (creating a concept map, listing definitions, summarizing formulas, ). Reading the textbook without actively engaging with it is not an effective method of studying. See for tips on studying mathematics.      Read with paper and pencil (or tablet and stylus) nearby  You should take notes (especially of definitions and theorems) in a dedicated place in your notebook or tablet. Put key words in the margins so you can quickly skim your notes to find information. Underline or highlight as you would like, but be careful not to overuse such markings. Periodically summarize the big ideas of what you are reading, either by using appropriate headers or at the margins of your paper. If you do not already have your own note-taking method, I recommend the Cornell Note Taking System. You can find details at https:\/\/lsc.cornell.edu\/how-to-study\/taking-notes\/cornell-note-taking-system\/ . This involves organizing your page into multiple sections to capture different types of information: notes, cues (could be questions or key words), and summary. Math makes the most sense when you see it done out in front of you. One of the main challenges to reading mathematics is following lengthy computations. Working through these on paper at the same time as reading will help you follow each step, as well as pinpoint when you stop being able to follow the computation. This may not be the best to do the first time you read, however, as you may get lost in the details and forget why you were doing the computation. However, if you feel your eyes glazing in over in the middle of a lengthy equation, writing it down will help you focus, capture all of the details, and retain it in your memory.    Keep track of your questions  If something doesn't make sense, write down (in your notes) an explicit question that could help you understand. Flag your notes with post-its or stars or some other way that you can easily find them again; this is a benefit to Cornell notes as there is a separate area for questions. As you read more, you may answer your own questions and can add those answers to your notes. If not, you will want to be able to find these questions to ask them during class, office hours, or tutoring.    Avoid distractions while reading and choose your work environment deliberately  You may be able to read a novel or magazine with Netflix in the background or chatting with friends. If you read math and are not really concentrating on it, you will get very little out of it, and it will seem more difficult than it really is. 30 minutes spent focusing solely on your reading is more beneficial than spending 3 hours \"reading\" while distracted. If you are reading as part of a study group, make sure to set some ground rules about how often people are allowed to ask questions. Experiment with different environments to find what allows you to focus best. Silence the notifications on your phone\/computer\/tablet while you are reading! If that makes you uncomfortable, set a timer to check your notifications periodically (no more than every 15 minutes). Listening to music may be too distracting for you, or it may help you resist other distractions. Vary the type of music you listen to; some people prefer anything familiar while others need soothing or loud music. You may work better in a familiar environment, such as your dorm room, or you may need an impersonal space, such as the library. You may need a quiet, still space, or you may need ambient noise and bustle. Consider drinking water or another beverage while reading, or rewarding yourself periodically with a small snack such as an M&M. Mathematicians famously like to work in coffee shops, both for the ambient noise and the ease of obtaining more caffeine! Lastly, you will need to find what time of day works best for you for reading. You may prefer to read first thing in the morning when your brain is fresh, or you may think best in the evening or late at night when you do not have to think about what to do for the rest of the day. You may be forced to read at a particular time based on your schedule, but try to pay attention to when during the day your brain seems the most ready to focus and work.    Keep the big picture in mind  Even though the details of mathematics are important, the way that they fit together to work toward a larger goal give them real meaning. For each section you read, make sure you know the key ideas that are introduced as well as how they relate to the key ideas of previous sections. Cornell Notes (linked above) are great at helping to do this as they provide an explicit section of the page in which to summarize what you've learned. As you go through a calculation, always remember why that calculation is being done. What problem does it solve? What larger goal do the symbols represent? As you read an example, think about what definitions and theorems it illustrates, or if it shows how a mathematical concept can be used beyond the classroom. Ask what the motivation is behind the definitions and formulas; why was it worth inventing them in the first place?    Pay attention to details  In mathematics, every symbol and word counts, each sentence contributes to the bigger picture, and every diagram, table, and figure is purposeful. If you are at all uncertain about the meaning of a term or symbol, look it up or ask someone to explain it. Keep a list of new vocabulary. Pay attention to how symbols are used within mathematical expressions. For example, there is a vast difference between the symbols , and in mathematics. You probably won't have time to work through every example while you read, but at some point, make sure you know how to get from each step of a calculation to the next. In particular, be sure to notice when a definition, theorem, or formula is being applied, or if there is some other short-cut being used to get from one line to the next. Being able to follow a solution is a precursor to being able to solve problems for yourself. You may need to reread sentences a few times in order to fully understand what they are saying. Pay particular attention to how it relates to the material that has come before and how it fits into the current context. Is it introducing a new idea, building on an old idea, supporting a previous statement, pointing out something important, ?    Seek out alternate sources  This textbook contains all of the content you are responsible for, but that doesn't mean that it will contain enough examples or make perfect sense for every concept it introduces. Use other books, people, and technology to get answers to your questions and other perspectives on material that does not make sense to you. Do a quick internet search based on your questions, or ask your classmates, instructor, or tutors. YouTube is an excellent resource for modern learners of mathematics! However, be careful to find reputable sources for your information. Some of the best channels I've found are:    Khan Academy      The Organic Chemistry Tutor      patrickJMT      Professor Dave Explains      K. O. Math      Professor Heather Pierce Disclaimer: this is a friend of mine from graduate school, but she makes some great videos!      Numberphile (more for general interest; less instructional)     Hands on Math      Mathispower4u      ProfRobBob      Professor Leonard     If you prefer an alternate online textbook, here are two good options:    Paul's Online Math Notes      Active Calculus and Active Prelude to Calculus       Make it your own  The most important thing to do while reading math is to find a system that works for you and to make the content that you are learning relevant to your own interests. Everyone has a different set of tools and a different level of \"chunking up\" complicated ideas. Make the idea fit in with your own perspective and experience. Some people are most satisfied when they see a mathematical idea unfold from start to finish, following an idea from its origins and rediscovering why it is true, either via logical reasoning or experimentation. Other people need to contextualize information in a real-world context, in which case they prefer to motivate an idea with an application or tangible problem.

Definitions, Examples, and Theorems  The last section held general advice. This one contains specific directions for making sure you catch the most important parts of your reading. Pay special attention to definitions, examples, and theorems in a math text. They generally contain the most useful information and are the structure used to organize a mathematical text.   Definitions  Mathematics uses words very precisely, and not always in the same way that you would use them in your daily life. Mathematical definitions give the precise meaning of certain words that are meant to represent a specific idea. Words are typically written in bold the first time they are defined, which is intended to make them stand out from the surrounding text. If they are especially important, they are numbered and labeled, like so:  The words function, function notation, independent variable, and dependent variable are defined. The definition is numbered and has an orange bar to the left to make it more visible.   The above definition may or may not make sense to you or agree with what you think of when you hear the word \"function.\" If you don't immediately understand a definition, you may need to come back to it again later after reading some examples, asking questions, or finding alternate explanations of the term via Google or YouTube. When you encounter a new mathematical definition, you should write the term in your notes along with the accompanying definition, along with any other ideas that help you to understand it. While trying to be as precise as possible, write the mathematical meaning of the word in your own words, potentially accompanied by an example or two to help understand what the definition is intended to mean.    Theorems and Formulas  A mathematical Theorem is typically extremely important. If definitions are stones and examples show you how to put them together, then a theorem is a finished archway or wall. It is a mathematical fact, formula, classification, or connection between ideas that is especially useful for some purpose or is the culmination of a string of ideas leading to a particular goal. Think of mathematical knowledge as the city that is made up of houses constructed from the walls and archways of Theorems.  Definitions are put together to form Theorems. Theorems fit together to form a body of knowledge, such as the Theory of Calculus.   Theorems can also be called Propositions, Corollaries, or Lemmas , though we will not get into the distinction between these, and are typically so important that they are separated from the surrounding text in a shaded box. They are numbered so that they can be referred to easily:   Theorem 1.1 is a \"classification\" and gives a visual condition that categorizes a graph as either a function or not a function. The theorem also has a name by which it is commonly referred: the Vertical Line Test. Names of theorems often serve to remind us of their contents, though sometimes they refer to the person who discovered the theorem.   Theorem 1.2 is a \"formula\" and provides a short-cut for factoring the difference of two numbers or expressions that are written as squares.   Theorem 1.3 tells us a mathematical \"fact\" about products of numbers or expressions that are equal to zero. This is a very important property that relies on the theoretical structure of real numbers and real-valued functions. Theorem 1.3 is also the connection between the algebraic method of factoring and the task of solving an equation. Whenever you see a theorem, you should add it to you notes and take extra special care that you understand the purpose and meaning of the theorem. Because this course will not focus on mathematical proofs (logical arguments that explain rigorously why a theorem is true), you may or may not fully understand why a theorem is always true. The text should provide enough examples to suggest why it is true, or you could come up with a few more examples on your own if you are not yet convinced.    Examples and Non-Examples  It's not usually possible to get a full understanding of a concept without seeing it used a few times. The purpose of examples is to build your intuitive understanding, either by motivating an idea, clarifying details of a definition, theorem, or formula, showing how the idea can be used in context or to solve a problem, or providing multiple viewpoints from which to think about an idea. They may be mentioned briefly in a paragraph and you will have to recognize them via key words like, \"For instance \" and \" such as \". Other times, they are contained in separate environments meant to call more attention to them:   Example 1.1 follows immediately after Definition 1.1 in the text and illustrates the idea of a function introduced there, as well as the terms independent and dependent variable. It also introduces a new symbol and its meaning, the set of all real numbers. If Definition 1.1 did not make sense to you when you read it earlier, return to it and compare it with this example to see how the abstracted ideas in the definition are made more concrete in this example.   Example 1.22 follows Theorem 1.2 in the text as shown, and demonstrates how to use the formula presented for factoring a difference of squares.   Example 1.23 follows Theorem 1.3 in the text as shown. It begins with an expression that was factored in a previous example, and demonstrates how the property of multiplication in Theorem 1.3 allows us to set each of the factored expressions equal to zero and solve in order to determine where the full expression is equal to zero. The example goes on to contextualize the calculation graphically and provides a clickable link to a Desmos graph (you should always click on these as you are reading) in order to verify that the algebraic work is correct. A \"non-example\" is typically an example of something that does not fit a mathematical idea.   Example 1.8 illustrates how Theorem 1.1, the Vertical Line Test, is applied, and also provides an example of a graph that is NOT a function, meaning a \"non-example\" of a function. Non-examples are often just as enlightening as examples, if not more-so, because they show the limitations of the mathematical idea.     The four examples above illustrate definitions and theorems found in the text. Example 1.23 also makes connections to methods demonstrated in another example and a way of verifying and visualizing the result of a calculation. Some examples may illustrate a general method of solving a category of problems. Motivational examples may give you an intuitive or contextual introduction into an idea, while applied examples show you how a mathematical idea can be used in a real-world problem.  Here is a list of strategies to experiment with that can help you get the most benefit from the examples provided in the textbook. You do not have to implement all of them all of the time, but should consider these as suggestions to add to your toolbox of reading strategies:   Whenever you see an example, you should always think about what purpose it is serving. A good question to ask yourself is, \"How is this an example of what I was just reading?\"    Some examples will pose a problem to be solved and demonstrate how to solve it. Think about how to answer the problem, even for just a moment, before you read the solution. If you don't know where to start or were very wrong, you know you did not understand the concept underlying the example and may want to skim over earlier material again after reading the solution.    Summarize the main idea of an example after reading it and how it relates to the definition, theorem, formula, idea, etc. that it is meant to illustrate.    Make note of any questions that come into your mind as you read the example, such as how to get from one step of a calculation to the next, or whether the same idea could be used in a different context.    Try to think of other similar examples, as well as non-examples, before moving on to a new topic.       Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: Definition, theorem, proposition, corollary, lemma, example and non-example  Key ideas: Reading mathematics requires you to be actively involved in order to understand what is written. You will have to find a balance between efficiency and thoroughness in order to effectively learn from a mathematical text without spending hours and hours reading. This will likely take some experimentation with different strategies, so be patient and give yourself time to build this important skill.  \\fbox{Remember to return to Canvas and complete the Section 0.1 R&R!}  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 0.1}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "title": "How to Problem-Solve",
  "body": " How to Problem-Solve    Attribution: The framework and contents of this section were developed by Dr. Juliana Belding for the course MATH1100 Calculus I at Boston College, reproduced here with permission.    Learning Goals    Learn a framework for tackling complicated problems    Practice implementing the framework    Dispel some common myths about problem-solving      Why Problem Solving?   Problem-solving can mean many things. One way to describe it is as the ability to take an unfamiliar problem, make sense of the problem and come up with a way to solve it.  We'll work with both word problems and other problems. In particular, word problems are a training ground for the skill of mathematizing a situation that has words and numbers. We're not pretending these are necessarily realistic word problems but the point is for you to further develop your skills in more simplified situations and build your confidence. The hope is that this helps you become more comfortable looking at situations in a mathematical way, as you encounter more complicated ones.  Here we share a framework This framework is modified from that generated by George Polya, with credit also to Gizem Kaarali, Darly Cooper, Walter and Brown. to help you approach problems in an organized way. We'll explain it below and give examples of how you might use it.      Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Make a Plan    Carry out Your Plan    Reflect Back    Critique and\/or Change the Problem      Why a Framework?    A framework provides a structure to support logical problem-solving and slows you down, which is a good thing at first. As opposed to worrying that you can't remember how to solve the problem immediately, you get used to brainstorming and taking time to make sense of the problem.    A framework provides a common language so students in different sections can better work with each other and with instructors and TAs from other sections.     Very Important!! We are NOT suggesting that there is always one way to approach a math problem. This framework is meant to support you to work on a problem in a systematic yet individual, creative way. In particular,   In homework or class, we'll periodically ask you to try to use the framework. You will not be graded on precise use of the framework, but instead on the work shown and final results of your problem-solving.    We may model using the framework in class and in written solutions. Your work might look different or occur in different order than examples we provide. That is fine!    You may have a different approach to problem-solving that you like to use. That is fine! This is not meant to replace that, but rather to provide a(nother) pathway to problem-solving.       Problem-Solving Framework  Here's the framework. Warning! It can be overwhelming to read all at once. Instead we recommend you try an example problem alongside. Keep track of the things you do, and then come back to the framework, and see how it might help with solving the problem.   An Example Problem   A swimming pool is 2 m deep, 5 m wide and 60 m long. Water is pumped into it at the constant rate of 100 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the pool?  (Source: Cooper, 3.1.6)      1. Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)  Here are some possible things to do to help you understand the problem. You don't need to necessarily do all of them or to do them in a particular order.   Read it over once.    Visualize if possible: draw a diagram or picture, or sketch a rough graph.    Focus on what is being asked: What is the unknown information or the goal of the problem? What information is known?    Identify different quantities that might be relevant. Are they constant? Are they variables? Are they parameters?    Define notation and variables. Translate known and unknown information into notation and variables.       2. Make a Plan  In this step, the big point is to slow down and allow yourself to think versus trying to rely on a memorized approach. You brainstorm what could be relevant or useful to know or to do, and then make a plan to do it. You can actually carry out the plan in the next step. Here are some questions to help you.   What connections or relationships are there between known and unknown quantities? Does one change with the other?    What math tools, concepts, or formulas might be relevant?    Would making a table, function formula or graph be useful?    Is this like any familiar problem?    Then   Read over the problem again and decide which of the tools, relationships, are actually relevant and useful and make a step-by-step plan to use them.    Note: Your plan might not be the same as another person's. There are many pathways to solve a problem! Also, you may have done some work in \"Meet the Problem\" that helps you make a plan. These two steps are very connected.   3. Carry out Your Plan  In this step, you actually do the work of the plan, computing a value, graphing, solving an equation or whatever you planned.   Along the way, look back at what you planned. Are you on track?    Do you need to modify your plan?       4. Reflect Back (Looking Back)  In this step, we look back to see if we've solved the problem, check our work and think about what we've learned. Here are some questions to help you.   Have you answered the question(s)?    Can you check your answer?    Did you include units, if necessary? Do a unit check: do the units make sense?    Can you interpret the answer? Does it make sense?    Was all of the information relevant or needed?    Does the answer fit your intuition? What surprised you, if anything?       5. Critique and Change the Problem  This is an optional step, but it is a great way to exercise your critical thinking, get curious and creative, and think about how the problem might connect to more real-world situations.   Were assumptions made in the problem? What were they? Are they reasonable?    \"Word Problems\" in math classes are notoriously artificial. In what ways is the problem NOT realistic or practical? How could you change it to better reflect reality?    How would you change the problem to make it more interesting?    What other questions are you curious about after solving this problem?         Some Myths of Problem-Solving    Myth: If you can't solve a problem in 5 minutes, this means you can't do it  Definitely not! It might mean re-reading the problem to see it with new eyes, taking a break, or talking to a friend, classmate, or instructor about what you are thinking (but not asking them how to do it).    Myth: There is only one way to solve a problem  There are many ways to solve most every problem. We are sharing a framework, not a formula. Your work using this framework may look different than your peers or instructor.    Myth: Problems only have one right answer.  While this will be true of most of the problems we do in this course, in many situations, there are a range of answers depending on the assumptions and parameters of the problems.      Examples of Worked Problems  This section contains a few examples to help you understand the framework. Try the problems first using the framework, then see the examples here.  You'll notice that there is NOT one way to use the framework. You might have written more or less than here. The author here included some side thoughts, too, in parentheses. As you solve problems, you should feel free to add your personality and make it your own!   Here is a worked solution to Example . Remember: there are many ways to apply this framework! Your process may vary substantially to what is shown below.    Meet the Problem (Understanding the Problem)    Our goal is the time in minutes for filling the pool.    We know the dimensions of the pool. 60 m, 5 m, 2 m    The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is . It looks like this:  The pool is a rectangular box and volume of a box is .       We know the rate of water into the pool is 100 liters per minute.    Total Amount is rate time.      Make a Plan Here's one sample plan.    Find the volume.    Divide by the filling rate to find the time: , so .    The dimensions of the pool are in meters but the rate is in liters per minute. So we'll have to find a conversion before dividing or change units afterwards. We can use that 1 m  1,000 liters. A quick Google search will tell you this. We have a choice: cubic meters to liters or from liters to cubic meters? Let's do the first one An alternate plan: Convert the rate 100 L\/min to a rate with units cubic meters per minute. You get a rate of 0.1 cubic meters per minute. .       Carry out Your Plan   Volume cubic meters.    Now we need to convert. We want to convert cubic meters to liters. Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 L, the total volume in liters is L. (More than I expected!)    Divide by the filling rate to find the time. Since , we have , so .       Reflect Back (Looking back)   Did we answer the problem? It said \"how long\"? So 6,000 minutes. This is hard to think about, so how many days would this take? There are minutes in a day, so this is about 4 days.    This seems too long. Did we make an error? Did we forget a zero? After checking, we see we did not.    We always want to check units. Here's where we might catch ourselves if we forgot to convert, since we'd get units of cubic meters per (liters\/minute) which is not just minutes.    This seems like a long time, but this is a big pool (60 m is longer than an Olympic pool).       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This pool is odd-shaped. It's long but not that deep. How does it compare to an Olympic-size swimming pool?    It might not be realistic for the rate to be always constant. What happens if the rate varies?    Can we make a function to predict the volume at any point in time?    What if the pool also leaks water, or if there is a circulation of water in and out?          The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers, and someone has just made a metal band that circles the Earth, touching the ground at all locations. You come along at night, as a practical joke, and add 10 m to its length. The band is now sits magically just above the ground at all locations creating a gap.  How far is the new band above the ground: could a flea, a rabbit or even a person pass underneath it?  (Source: Band around the Earth Puzzle)    Here we work through all steps of the framework. Note: your work might look different or occur in different steps!    Meet the Problem ((Understanding the Problem)    We know the original band has circumference about 40,000 km.    The new band has circumference which is 10 m longer, so 40,000 km + 10 m.    We need to know how much space is created between the band and the earth.    Here a picture is worth a lot:  A band around the Earth that has been lengthened by 10 m.   From the picture, we see the space we want is the difference in the radius of the bands. We have the original radius and the new radius .    I wonder what can fit? 10 m seems small compared to the total circumference, so I'm guessing a flea.      Make a Plan   We can measure the space using the radius: The space is the difference between the new band radius and the original band radius.    The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we can use to find the original radius .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, so we can use to find the new radius . We need to convert 10 m to km first.    Then subtract the original radius from the new radius.    Then we can compare that to the height of typical things.     An alternate plan: There are other ways to approach this. For example, we can name the gap , since it's the change in radius. Then , and . The difference in circumference is 10 m and it's so we can solve for that gap.    Carry out Your Plan   The original band is 40,000 km in circumference, so we solve to find the original radius, .    The new band is 40,000 km + 10 m in circumference, which is 40,000.01 km. We solve for ,    The space is km, or 1.6 meters.    1 meter is 3 feet, so this 4.8 feet. This is enough for person to pass under (if they bend down). Surprising!       Reflect Back (Looking Back)   I'm surprised it's this big a gap. I need to check I converted everything correctly.    I notice that it doesn't seem to matter how big the original circumference is because . The change in radius only depends on the change in circumference, not the original circumference.       Critique and\/or Change the Problem Here are some things we commented on, but you might have different ones. This is a place to be curious and think beyond the boundaries of the problem.    This is a strange problem - how could we make a band around the earth? Also, why is this a funny joke?    The earth isn't perfectly spherical. How does that affect it? Does it matter where we add the 10 meters?    Does it matter the size of the sphere? Would this be true on the moon? On Mars?    What sort of application could this have?    What can we learn about how radius and circumference are related?           The Northeast Regular train leaves NY for Boston at noon going a constant rate of 55 mph.

Now million trees. We can also calculate million trees and that million trees as well (according to a calculator), so there appear to be 3 million trees remaining after a long time.    Reflect Back (Looking Back) We answered the question. There are about 3.00003 million trees at the start of 2030. As a basic check, we see this is less than the original 5 million which makes sense since trees have died off and there were no new trees. As time goes on, fewer and fewer of the susceptible trees will be left. Eventually, the population remaining will be only the non-susceptible trees, so million trees, as calculated.

  "title": "How to Study Math",
  "body": " How to Study Math  Math is a subject best learned in small increments over a long period of time. Cramming for hours at a time is not an effective way to learn mathematics. The best thing you can do to help you study is to schedule relatively short (30 minutes - 1 hour) study sessions for yourself spaced out over the course of several days or weeks, as often as needed based on the amount of improvement you wish to achieve and how much material you hope to cover.  Leading up to an exam, you may wish to lengthen your study sessions, but do not push yourself past the point of mental fatigue. You will simply get frustrated and will not retain the material you review. Avoid working on math when tired. Think about the times of day when you are best able to focus and try to study during them.  Most importantly, find other students with whom to study . Do not work with someone far above or below your own level of understanding, but rather someone with whom you can exchange ideas equitably. Take turns suggesting problems or topics to review and explaining solutions and ideas to each other. Ideally, each of you understands what the other does not. However, you will also benefit from combining your partial understandings. The social interaction involved in working with another person will help you retain the information you learn. At the very least, making plans with another person to study will hold you accountable for using that time as intended.    Resources you can use to study  Plan when you begin studying to give yourself enough time to attend office hours or tutoring to ask questions. The resources below are available to you in order to identify what you need to know:    Your notes from reading and from class    Problems from in-class worksheets and the posted solutions    Old Check-Your-Understanding problems. Some have solutions that you can view after the due date.    Homework problems and posted solutions    Online resources, such as YouTube or online textbooks. There are specific suggestions in . Seeing an alternate explanation and additional examples may help you understand a topic. Just be aware that different sources do not all cover topics in the same way and material that you find online may not be relevant to the course; if something seems entirely unfamiliar and you can't find something similar in course materials, chances are it's not something you are responsible for knowing.    Explanations and examples in the textbook. Warning: Many people try to study by simply reading through a text from start to finish. This is not an effective way to learn. If you plan to read the textbook to study, you need to read actively. See below for details on active reading as it pertains to mathematical texts.      How to study effectively  A great way to begin your studying is to create a concept map of the big ideas being tested on the exam. Include all of the relevant definitions, theorems, and formulas. Reread comments left on homework and see which Check-Your-Understanding problems took you the most attempts to get correct. Do not study everything, but rather focus on those topics that give you the most trouble.     Practice Problems Math is best learned by actively solving problems. When practicing problems, complete them on your own with as little help from your notes or another person as possible. Only resort to consulting other resources when you are stuck and have already tried to get un-stuck.     Use Homework as Assessment Similar to the above point, use the work that you already have to do as a way to assess your understanding as you do it. Avoid copying methods from examples and their solutions but rather review your notes and then try the problem without looking.     Check your Solutions Use solutions to check your own work. If you get the same final answer, make sure that the intervening steps are the same or at least equivalent. If you use a different method to complete a problem than the solutions, compare them: Where do they differ? Which is more efficient? Which is more applicable to other, similar problems? If you do not get the same final answer, determine how much of your work is correct and precisely what kind of mistake you made.    If your mistake was based on faulty conceptual understanding, review or make a note to review material related to that concept.    If your mistake was computational, what can you do in the future to avoid the same mistake? If you find yourself consistently making the same computational mistakes, make a mental note to double-check your work whenever doing similar calculations.       Write Your own Practice Exams Combine problems from homework and worksheets and either do them yourself, or trade with a study partner. Having to solve a problem out of the context of a section of the text is a test-like challenge that is good to practice. Moreover, anticipating which problems are \"test-worthy\" and thinking from the perspective of the instructor can help you to anticipate the types of problems that will be on the exam.     Learn by Teaching and Learn as if to Teach Explaining an idea will make it stick better in your mind, so take turns in your study group explaining problems to each other. When working on your own, don't study with the intention of solving problems: study with the intention of teaching other people to solve problems. How much more thoroughly would you prepare to give a 50-minute lecture than you would to take a 50-minute test? Study as if you will be standing at the front of the class giving explanations, rather than sitting in a seat working on paper.     Review the Theory Review the definitions and theorems covered in class. Do not simply read through them, however. Find examples (from homework, the book, online) that relate back to them and explicitly connect the example with the ideas in the theory. Give a few examples that fit the definition or theorem, and try to find examples that do not fit. Compare them and determine what differences make the definition or theorem apply\/not apply.     Review the Computation Review all of the formulas and methods covered in class. Ideally, homework has given you enough practice with these so that you retain them. If not, find additional problems to practice. If you find yourself having a very hard time applying these quickly, make yourself a study sheet (maybe a notecard or a separate piece of paper) where you copy over the formula\/method and write out an example or two using that method. Briefly review this study sheet several times a day.   If using a notecard, you may wish to put the formula\/method on one side and examples on the other side.    If using a piece of paper, fold it down the middle and put the formula\/method and examples on opposite sides of the crease.        Read Actively Many people like to review their notes or the textbook to study. However, simply reading through explanations and examples is not an effective way to learn material. Do not confuse familiarity with understanding. You must read actively to benefit from reading, which for mathematics means:   Rework any examples or computations (with a pen or pencil on a separate piece of paper). Make a note of any steps you do not follow but don't let them get in your way of continuing to read. It's possible something included later in the text will clear up your confusion.    Identify the main idea of the section as well as the main idea of each subsection or paragraph. Connect these ideas: how does the material in the section support the main idea? How does the main idea of the section tie together the ideas of each subsection? There's no need to formally summarize your reading, but it's very useful to think about the big picture ideas as a way of understanding the details.    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to explicit examples that relate to them. Why do these examples fit? What change in the example would make it no longer fit? How are the specific details of the theory represented in the problem (for example, if there are constants used in the theorem, like a and b, that are given specific values in the example).    Connect the theory and ideas discussed to other sections covered in the text. What ideas does this section use? Where are these ideas used in subsequent sections?    If there are any words that you do not understand, look them up! If they were previously defined in the book, they will be listed in the index. If you can't find where they are defined, you can always google them. Just make sure that you are looking at a relevant mathematical definition. Oftentimes, words are defined to have very specific mathematical meanings that are not the same as their colloquial use. Sometimes, different areas of mathematics will use the same words to mean different things, so make sure the definition you find is familiar or seems relevant.        Seek Help from your Instructor The best place to get help is office hours. These are times your instructor has set aside to meet with students. You do not need an appointment to go. Questions can be about specific problems but can also be more general. Do not go with a laundry list of questions to get answered right before an exam, but rather attend office hours regularly and ask a few questions each time. Formulate your question (and write it down) ahead of time so that you can use the face-to-face time with your instructor productively. Bring any work you have attempted on a problem and show your instructor so that they can pick up precisely where you need help.      \\part{Fall Semester}  "

  "body": " What is a Function?    Functions Definition     Learning Goals    Understand the definition of a mathematical function.    Know terminology associated with functions: domain, range, independent and dependent variable.    Use four different ways to represent a function.    Recognize when a relationship is or is not a function; the Vertical Line Test.    Use different notations to describe sets: inequalities and intervals.    Explore some preliminary examples of functions used in real-world contexts.      The Definition of a Function  A function is a fundamental mathematical object that will form the basis of everything we study this year. In this section, we will explore their definition and its meaning, several ways of representing a function, and a physical example of how functions are manifest in real-world phenomena.  What does the word \"function\" mean to you? Pause for a moment and consider   If you look up \"function\" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary (click on this link: https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function ), there are many different meanings. Which ones agree with the ideas you already had? The fifth entry  https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/function accessed August 1, 2022 is the one we shall use, and we shall use both parts of it:  function (noun)   a mathematical correspondence that assigns exactly one element of one set to each element of the same or another set    a variable (such as a quality, trait, or measurement) that depends on and varies with another For example \"Height is a function of age.\"    Part (a) of this definition is the abstracted, theoretical idea of a function. Part (b) of this definition is the reason we are interested in functions: we wish to describe relationships between real-world quantities. We will begin with the abstract idea before applying this knowledge to something more concrete.  Here is a formal, mathematical statement that we shall take to be the precise meaning of the word \"function\" for the rest of the year. Return to it as you read the examples that follow in order to make sense of the notation and terminology.   Function, Independent and Dependent Variables    Functions Independent Variable  Functions Dependent Variable A function  is a rule that takes certain numbers in the set as inputs and assigns to each a single number in the set as the output.  The notation represents a function together with its input set and output set . It is pronounced \" from to .\" The notation , pronounced \" is equal to of ,\" represents the assignment of the output to the input .  The collection of symbols is called function notation , where the in parentheses is called the independent variable and represents the input of the function. The output of the function is represented by either or , which is called the dependent variable because its value depends on the choice of input.     It is particularly important that each input has only one output. Think about the function as a machine, the input as a command, and the output as a task the machine will perform based on which command you give. When you give the machine an instruction, it should consistently perform a predictable task. You don't want it to be unpredictable and do different tasks based on the same instruction.     For example, the rule that takes a real number and squares it is a function. Since the result is also a real number, we write where the symbol is used to represent the set of all real numbers . In this example, is both our input and our output set. This will be the case for many of the examples we study this semester.  Introducing some notation, let's call the number we are squaring so that once we square it, we may write . We can pick the name to refer to this function by writing , which is pronounced \" of is equal to squared.\" Thus we have chosen as the symbol we use to represent our independent variable . We can also choose to represent our outputs with the dependent variable  and can use the notation or to represent the fact that the values of are the result of squaring , or equivalently, applying the function to .  For instance, if we choose the input value , then we write , which is read \" of is equal to squared, which is equal to .\" The number is the output of the function when the input is .  We could also use the input value , and then we would write , which is read \" of negative is equal to negative squared, which is equal to .\" The number is again the output of the function when the input is .  The pictures below illustrate how the function behaves as a machine that takes the input ( , or ) to the output ( , or ).         What are two other examples of functions that you can think of? These may be mathematical examples that you have seen before, or they may be real-world examples of a quantity that varies depending on another. Try to be creative!    In Example , you saw two different ways of representing the same function: a description in words (a rule that squares numbers) and a formula ( ). There are two additional ways to represent a function (a table and graph), making four total ways to represent a function:   a description in words    a formula    a table    a graph     We will need to be able to work with all four of these representations. Depending on what information we are given and what questions we have, one may be more or less useful than another.    Continuing with our function that squares numbers, it would be very tedious to list out all of the different assignments for the function one by one, so instead we can collect them in a table. below has inputs of the function in the top row with their corresponding outputs below them in the second row:   A table of values of the function    \\toprule     0  1  2  3    \\midrule  9  4  1  0  1  4  9    \\bottomrule     We soon realize that this is also quite tedious. After all, we have only listed seven values of the function and they are all integers. What about all of the decimals between them??? It would be much quicker to illustrate all of the assignments of the function in a picture. below shows the graph of the function with the values from labeled, along with a few other points. The input values appear on the horizontal axis while the output values appear on the vertical axis.   A graph of the function .        Looking back over Examples and , which type of representation do you understand the best? Which do you understand the least? What are some different scenarios where each representation may be most useful?      Domain and Range of a Function  The function in Examples and is fairly typical in that both the input and output sets are numbers; most of the functions we consider this year will have numbers as inputs and outputs. In order to be more precise in our discussion of functions, we introduce some additional terminology to describe the input and output sets:   Domain and Range of a Function   If is a function between unspecified subsets of , then we will take the domain of to be the largest subset of for which is defined: . The range of such a function is the set of all possible outputs that it can attain:       Returning to the squaring function in Example . Because we can take any number as an input and successfully square it, the domain of is indeed the set of all real numbers . However, notice that some real numbers can never serve as outputs, because squares of real numbers can never be negative. The range of the squaring function is real numbers that are greater than or equal to zero. Here are two different ways of describing that set symbolically:   With \"set notation\" where the symbol \" \" means \"in\" and the symbol \" \" means \"such that,\" so that this expression translates directly as \"the set of in the real numbers such that is greater than or equal to zero.\" It is more common to omit the formal set notation and simply use the inequality .    With \"interval notation\" where the symbol \" \" means that we include the left endpoint and the symbol \" \" means that we do not include right endpoint; together with the infinity symbol , the right side of this interval extends forever. We can visualize this on a number line:           While we will only refer to the domain and range of a function, there is another set that you may encounter relating to functions: the codomain . When we use the notation to represent a function, the set is the domain but the set is called the codomain and does not have to be the same as the range of the function. The range of a function is either equal to or is a subset of the codomain. For example, when looking at the function defined by in Example , the codomain is while the range is the set of numbers greater than or equal to .    A Function with a Square Root   Consider the function . We can successfully use the value as an input because   So we see that the output is defined as the input of , hence is in the domain of . Similarly, we can plug in the values , and , along with the values and :   A table of values of the function    \\toprule      0  1  2  3  4    \\midrule      2        \\bottomrule     However, if we try to plug in , we do not get an output because we cannot take square roots of negative numbers: . Thus ARE in the domain of while is NOT in the domain of . How can we determine exactly where the domain begins and ends? Since we need the quantity inside the square root to be non-negative, meaning 0 or greater, we set up and solve the inequality   Hence any value of that is equal or less than 4 is in the domain, which we write as either or .  Determining the range of is aided by looking at a graph:   A graph of the function .    Thus we see that the smallest value we can get as an output is , while it looks like the values of continue to increase as the values of become more and more negative. Thus from the graph, it appears that the range of the function is .     A Function with a Denominator   Below is the graph of the function . Note that even though there are three distinct curves that make up the graph, each -value only has one part of the curve above or below it, so we can determine from the curve the associated -value given by the function. For instance, the point on the graph is plotted in blue, and we can estimate from the picture that . Finding the precise value from the formula, we see that    A graph of the function .    Looking closely at the graph, it appears that the parts of the curve near and become nearly vertical, and it's not clear what -value we are meant to use for and . In fact, there are NO -values associated with and ; and are not in the domain of this function!  We can see algebraically that when we try to compute the value of the function at , we end up dividing by , which is undefined:   Similarly, is undefined:   These are the only -values for which the denominator is equal to , You will learn how to determine this in . so we can confirm from both the graph and the formula of the function that its domain is . which we can write using interval notation as . The round parentheses mean we do not include the endpoints at and , and is the \"union\" symbol, which means we are glueing the intervals together.  From the graph, it appears that the range of does not include all values of ; the right- and left-most parts of the graph approach the -axis, and so the -values get close to , but the middle part of the graph has a distinct gap at the top and the -values do not seem to quite reach 0. Experiment with the graph of by clicking on the Desmos graph  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/7sh4jaq0ox . The point is plotted in purple and there is a slider where you can adjust the values of . Note that Desmos gives a value for everywhere except for when and .  We can see using the Desmos graph that the highest point on the middle part of the graph occurs at when . Thus the range of includes all values of that are greater than 0, from the left and right curves, or that are less than or equal to , from the middle curve. This is written in interval notation as:       Non-Functions and the Vertical Line Test  So, what isn't a function? If a rule assigns a real-number input to more than one output, then that rule is not a function. In this subsection, we learn a theorem to help us determine graphically whether or not a relationship is a function.   A Non-Example   For example, consider the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable where the square of is equal to . We could write this as , where we remember that the input is . For example, if we take , then the output is a number that squares to . This could be either or , since and . Since we don't know which to choose, we say that \" is not defined as a function of .\"  Algebraically, we could try to \"solve\" the equation for by writing , and we see that we have the same issue where the input corresponds to two different -values, both and .  If you think of a function as a machine or algorithm that is required to return a single value, this ambiguity in having either or as our output can be thought of as a program that crashes and fails to complete its task.    Here is another example of a relationship between variables that does not describe a function.   A relationship described by a formula and graph that is NOT a function   The relationship between the variables and given by the equation is graphed in below in red.   The red circle is the points that satisfy the equation .    If we let , we can solve for :   The points and are labeled in blue and green, respectively. Thus we see that when , there are two  -values given by the equation instead of , and without more information, we do not know which to use. So we see that cannot be defined as a function of from the equation , even though it defines a very nice curve (a circle of radius 4).  Note that was picked at random. You can see from the picture of the circle that there are many other points where a single -value corresponds to two different -values, in particular anywhere that a vertical line passes through the circle twice.    Let's summarize the key property that determines whether or not a relationship or process is a function: each input has one and only one output. Thus, the usual way to demonstrate that a relationship or process is not a function is to find a particular input that is associated with two or more outputs. When the relationship is given graphically, we can use the vertical line test to determine whether or not the graph represents a function:   The Vertical Line Test    Functions Vertical Line Test A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.  When the graph passes this test, the vertical coordinate of each point on the graph can be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate of the point. When the graph does not pass this test, the vertical coordinate cannot be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate.     A graph that is not a function   In , the marked vertical line passes through the graph twice, and so the graph does not pass the Vertical Line Test. Thus the vertical coordinate cannot be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate .   A graph that does not pass the Vertical Line Test is not a function.    This graph corresponds to the equation . Because we already know from the Vertical Line Test that is not a function of , we cannot rewrite this equation as , where is some expression involving only the variable .      Think about a relationship between two quantities in an area of your own interest that satisfies the definition of a function. First, give a verbal description of this relationship. Next, pick variable names for each of the quantities involved and specify which is the independent and dependent variable. Lastly, explain why this relationship assigns to each input one and only one output (in other words, the relationship passes the Vertical Line Test if you graph the dependent variable on the vertical axis and the independent variable on the horizontal axis).      Which of the relationships below are functions? Which are not?   The relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.    The relationship between people and phone numbers.    The relationship between and given by .  A relationship between and    \\toprule     3  4  5    \\midrule  0         \\bottomrule        The relationship between and given by .  A relationship between and    \\toprule     0  1  2  3    \\midrule     0  1  4  9    \\bottomrule              The relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter is a function. If we are given a diameter, we can determine the circumference of the correspondingly sized circle in an unambiguous way. Can you remember how? This will be answered later in this section.    The relationship between people and phone numbers is NOT a function. A given individual person can be associated with more than one phone number, such as their cell phone and their work telephone. This means that we can't view phone numbers as a function of people: one input (a person) can lead to two different outputs (phone numbers). We also can't view people as a function of phone numbers, since more than one person can be associated with a phone number, such as when a family shares a single phone at home.    The relationship between and is a function. If we view as the independent variable, there is only one value of associated to each. The reverse is also true: if we view as the independent variable, there is only one value of associated to each.     does NOT represent a function. cannot be a function of because if is the independent variable, the input corresponds to two different outputs and . Similarly, the input corresponds to two different outputs and . We also cannot view as a function of because if is the independent variable, the input corresponds to two different outputs and .         Real-world Examples of Functions  Let's take a closer look at two of the functions described in Example in order to get a sense of how functions can be used in the real-world.   A function described in words   Consider again the function defined by the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter. The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to the diameter of the circle, meaning that the ratio of the two quantities is a constant value. The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–501) estimated the value of by calculating the value of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. His approximation was . Other historical mathematicians independently estimated using the ratio of the area and radius of a circle. The ancient Babylonians (ca. 1900–1680 BC) estimated as . On the Rhind Papyrus (ca.1650 BC), Egyptian mathematicians recorded the value of as 3.1605. Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) showed that is between and . https:\/\/www.exploratorium.edu\/pi\/history-of-pi accessed August 4, 2022. happens to be the constant value , so we can write this relationship explicitly as where represents the circumference and is the diameter. If we choose to make the dependent variable and the independent variable , we can rewrite this relationship so that is a function of : . Given the diameter of a circle, you can find its circumference by multiplying by .     A function described in a table   Recall the table of values in . Typically, we would view as the independent variable and view as the dependent variable , meaning that is a function of , which we could write as . If we read from the table alone without any interpretation, the domain for the function is while the range is .  Now we add some context! Consider a tank in the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) where the tank's radius is 2 feet and its depth is 4 feet. See below.   The empty conical tank. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\caption{The conical tank, partially filled.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{A tank in the shape of an inverted circular cone (point down) with radius 2 feet and depth 4 feet is being filled with water.}  Suppose that the tank is being filled with water that is entering at a constant rate of cubic feet per minute. Initially, there is no water in the tank and after each subsequent minute, there is ft more water in the tank. below summarizes the relationship between the time that has passed and the volume of the water in the tank. This is the same as , except that now represents time and represents volume in a physical context where water is being added continuously to the tank.   How time and volume change in tandem in a conical tank    \\toprule (in minutes)     3  4  5    \\midrule (in ft )  0         \\bottomrule     We can now use some of our intuition from this new context to interpret the table. In the first five minutes, the values for tell us that the tank starts at 0 ft of water (empty) and fills to ft of water. We know that the volume is increasing steadily and so contains all values between 0 and , and no values outside that range, during the time frame from to . These are significant assumptions that come from our knowledge of the physical setting of the problem! Based on this deeper interpretation, we can say that on a domain of between 0 and 5 minutes, the range for is from 0 to ft .  Exercise will have you explore this function in even greater depth (no pun intended). We will also review it during class, but if you have time you should attempt it now.      Recall the conical tank being filled with water in Example . The table of values that we are given stops at seconds. How long could we continue to fill the tank before it overflows?   Plot the points given in on a set of axes with time in minutes on the horizontal axis and volume in ft on the vertical axis. What shape does the graph of the function seem to be?    Try to think of a formula for the function that gives the volume as a function of time, meaning a formula for . Use your graph from part (a) as inspiration.    Graph your formula from part (b) for (using Desmos) and confirm our earlier intuition that if takes on all values between and , steadily increases from to , and takes on no values outside of that range.    Now return to your intuitive understanding of the problem. What is the total volume of the conical tank? Hint: the volume of a cone is . What does this tell you about the largest possible volume of water in the cone? Use this and your formula for to determine how long it will take for the cone to overflow.      The conical tank, partially filled.        Interval Notation for Sets  When we talk about functions, they will always take some set of numbers as their domain and have some set of numbers as their range. In this section, we talk briefly about what a \"set\" is and some different notations for how to write them down.  You have already seen one mathematical shorthand for a commonly used set: denotes the set of all real numbers. Another useful notation is the empty set : denotes the set that contains nothing.   Please do not confuse with the number 0. They are VERY different and should NOT be used interchangeably.   Another set we discussed was the domain and range of the water in the tank in Example . We said that if the time is between 0 and 5 minutes, then the volume was between 0 and ft . We can write these using inequalities: , which are read \"0 is less than or equal to , which is less than or equal to 5\" and \"0 is less than or equal to , which is less than or equal to .\" An alternate notation for writing these two sets is called interval notation . The set is written and the set is written . This notation is nice and concise, but does not specify a variable and so can be confusing or ambiguous. If we wish to name the variable , we would write , read \" is in the set of numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 5 (inclusive).\" Likewise for , we can write , read \" is in the set of numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 3.75 (inclusive).\" The symbol means \"in\" and the square brackets indicate the the endpoints of the interval are included.  Other sets that you saw were the domain and range of the function in Example . The range can be written in interval notation as . The domain can be written in interval notation as . The meaning of this set is best illustrated on a number line:     The values of are allowed to be any number below , denoted by the open parentheses and on the left of the interval .  Another set that you saw was the domain of the function in Example . We wrote this using the standard shorthand of , which means that can take on any value except for and . To write this using inequalities, we would need three different parts: . The corresponding interval notation also has three parts: .  The round parentheses mean we do not include the endpoints at and , and is the \"union\" symbol, which means we are glueing the intervals together.  Finally, one more standard notation is an alternate way of writing the set of all real numbers: instead of writing , we can write . There is no way to write the empty set using interval notation; WeBWorK will typically have you enter the word \"none\" in cases where there is no solution.  Here is a table summarizing all of the above examples, along with a few more to help you understand when to use \" \" vs. \" \" and how to incorporate \" \".   A table of intervals written using interval notation    \\toprule  Interval notation    \\midrule     \\midrule  none    \\midrule  or    \\midrule  or    \\midrule  or    \\midrule  or    \\midrule     \\midrule     \\midrule     \\midrule or     \\midrule and     \\bottomrule       Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: function, set of all real numbers, domain, range, function notation, independent variable, dependent variable, graph, directly proportional, interval notation, the empty set   Key ideas: A relationship or process is a function if each individual input is associated with one and only one output. This is represented visually on graphs via the Vertical Line Test. There are four different ways to represent a function (words, formula, table, graph). The domain of a function is the set of all inputs with a defined output. The range of a function is the set of all realized outputs.   Other ideas introduced: You do not have to understand them now and likely have many questions about them. We will work on these ideas much more over the next few sections. interval notation will become a convenient way to represent sets of numbers, the inside of a square root cannot be negative and the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, the range of a function is not easy to find without a graph or table.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.1}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

Here are two different ways of describing that set symbolically:   With \"set notation\" where the symbol \" \" means \"in\" and the symbol \" \" means \"such that,\" so that this expression translates directly as \"the set of in the real numbers such that is greater than or equal to zero.\" It is more common to omit the formal set notation and simply use the inequality .    With \"interval notation\" where the symbol \" \" means that we include the left endpoint and the symbol \" \" means that we do not include right endpoint; together with the infinity symbol , the right side of this interval extends forever.

Explore how the parameters of a linear or quadratic function change the shape of its graph and its properties.    Use the different forms for equations for lines.    Solve quadratic equations via factoring or the quadratic formula.      Definitions of linear and quadratic functions   Linear and quadratic functions are important for modeling relationships between many different quantities. For example, in statistics, the method of Linear Regression seeks to find a line that best describes the relationship between quantities that appear to change at a constant rate relative to each other. Quadratic functions are used to model the height of an object falling under the force of gravity. We will explore several models that use linear and quadratic functions in after we develop our mathematical understanding of them.  We begin with the mathematical definitions of linear and quadratic functions. Recall that a mathematical definition is \"used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not.\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Definition accessed August 4, 2022. Thus the definitions below give us the precise meaning of a linear or quadratic function. Remember that we generally need a few examples to make sense of definitions, and these follow below each of the definitions.   Linear Functions   A linear function is a function that can be written in the form for some real numbers and . Alternately, a linear function can be written as a linear equation  , where is a dependent variable of the independent variable .     Examples of linear functions   Below are three examples of linear functions.   The equation defines as a linear function of , taking and in Definition     The equation also defines as a linear function of if we rewrite it as so that we see that we must take and . This function, is a special function, called the identity function , where the output and input are the same.    The equation is also a linear equation, so defines as a linear function (the independent variable isn't specified, though we can infer it to be ). To see this, rewrite it as so that we can see that we must take and . is an example of a constant function , which is a function of the form . For any input, the output is always , meaning the output is a constant number.       An important detail of the above definition is that a linear function can be rewritten in the form ; it may not look like that originally.    Rewrite in the form and identify and . These are two more examples of linear functions.     Quadratic Function   A quadratic function is one that may be written in the form , where , and are real numbers with . Alternately, a quadratic function can be written as a quadratic equation  , where is a dependent variable of the independent variable .    Similar to linear functions, quadratic functions can be written in the form but do not need to begin that way.    Rewrite each of the expressions below in the form and identify , and . These are examples of quadratic functions.                       Parameters  It is important to note that when we write an expression like or , only and are variables. The extra letters , and that are not variables are called parameters of the function. How should you think about these parameters and what they represent?  While the word parameter may be new to you, the concept is probably not so unfamiliar. We can think of a parameter as a \"dial\" on the function machine. Setting the dials to different values creates different functions. Analogy and Image from https:\/\/mathinsight.org\/function_machine_parameters     Think of a function as a machine that turns inputs into outputs. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\\textwidth} \\caption{Parameters are \"dials\" that adjust how the function machine works.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption   Parameters of Linear Functions   Consider the linear function:   Here is the independent variable and is the dependent variable. The letters and are parameters of the linear equation.   If we choose a specific value of and (\"set the dials\"), we get a specific line. For example, if and we get the linear function .    When we change the dials, we get a different line.       When we have a function with parameters , we can think of this function representing a whole family of functions, one for each combination of parameter values.    To get a hands-on feel for this, go to the Desmos site  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/uo5qirntxg .

Properties of Functions  The table that follows gives us vocabulary and precise mathematical definitions for various types of graphical behavior. Rows 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 describe behaviors that a function could exhibit at a specific point. Rows 3, 4, and 7 describe graphical behaviors that occur over an interval of real numbers.    uses as the independent variable and as the dependent variable. The notation is used to indicate particular values of and . We are using these instead of other letters because we have been using other letters to indicate parameters. A subscript is called an \"index\" (plural \"indices\"). The benefit to using these is that it is easier to keep track of whether they represent a value of the independent variable (for example, or ) or the dependent variable (for example, or ).    Properties of functions in terms of the behavior of their graphs    \\toprule  Vocabulary  Definition  Behavior    \\midrule 1.  has a -intercept or zero at   graph intersects the -axis at          2.  has a -intercept at   graph intersects the -axis at          3.  is positive on  for all  graph is above the -axis on          4.  is increasing on  for all in  graph moves up as we look from left to right on    \\midrule 5.  has a local maximum at  for all near  graph has a relative \"hilltop\" at          6.  has a global maximum at  for all  graph is the highest at          7.  is concave up on  values of grow at a faster and faster rate as increases on  graph curves upwards on like part of a \"U\"          8.  has an inflection point at  and the concavity of changes at  graph of changes from curving upward to curving downward, or vice versa, at    \\bottomrule     There are similar definitions for negative, decreasing, and concave down behavior, as well as local and global minima.  Notice that we describe extrema (maxima and minima) by where on the -axis they occur, since we can always find the corresponding -values from these -values. The concept of \"near\" in the description of a local maximum will be made more precise in Chapters 2 and 3. Inflection points and concavity cannot be precisely defined until we learn about derivatives in Chapter 3. In that chapter we will also learn ways for algebraically calculating the locations of extrema and inflection points. For now we present them just to set terminology and to familiarize ourselves with various types of function behavior; we will have to be content with examining such things graphically.    The -intercepts of are where , so at the values of with . Solving for :   So we see that has an -intercept at .  View a graph of via https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/uo5qirntxg and set the sliders to . From this we see that is positive (above the -axis) for and negative (below the -axis) for . The graph also tells us that is decreasing for , meaning for all values of .  The graph of has no local or global maxima or minima. This is true of all linear functions: none of them have any local or global extrema. Similarly, since the graphs of linear functions are lines, they are neither concave up nor concave down and do not have any inflection points.      The list that follows at the right describes each of the properties in the table above of the graph shown on the left.  \\fbox{ Use this example to check your understanding of each of the properties, going back and forth between and to identify each feature.}     Conjecture   A mathematical conjecture is \"is a conclusion or a proposition that is proffered on a tentative basis without proof.\"  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conjecture accessed August 5, 2022   Use the Desmos graph at  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/yayrd6etuz  and set the parameters to , and to graph the function .

Determine the intervals on which is concave up\/down. Are there any inflection points (where the concavity changes)? Conjecture: Play with the parameters , and and determine which parameter controls the concavity of a quadratic function.        Finding a \"good\" graphing window   Since we are using graphs to determine the properties of functions (for now), we should be especially careful that we can create a \"good\" graph of a function, meaning a graph that captures all of the key features and properties of the graph.  Here, we demonstrate finding a \"good\" graphing window for the graph of the function .  The three graphs that follow show in various graphing windows. Each of these windows is \"bad\" in the sense that the true behavior of the graph of is not represented.   Three \"bad\" graphing windows for . The properties of the graph are not accurately represented.    A \"good\" window (if one exists) is a window in which the local behavior of the graph of is clear and the global behavior is accurately represented (the \"ends\" of the graph keep going in the direction indicated). The following figure shows the graph of in a \"good\" window:   A \"good\" graphing windows for . The properties of the graph are accurately represented.    For now we will use trial and error to find an effective graphing window. Later, we will learn algebraic methods for determining all of these properties.      Different Equations of Lines  A line in the plane is completely described by its slope and -intercept . You could tell someone the values of and in a text message and they would know exactly which line you were referring to, without needing to attach a picture. We can also describe a line in the plane with its slope and the coordinates of any point on the line, or with the coordinates of any two points on the line. This last is how Euclid's Elements begin to develop geometry. Book I Postulate 1 states that given any two points, there is a line that joins them. https:\/\/mathcs.clarku.edu\/ djoyce\/elements\/bookI\/post1.html accessed August 17, 2022.   These three ways of describing lines give us three forms of equations for lines found in : slope-intercept form , point-slope form , and two-point form . Note that here we are again using indices to represent different values of the variables and . , and represent values of the independent variable , while , and represent values of the dependent variable .   Three forms for the equation of a line    \\toprule Name of form  Information given  Equation of line    \\midrule slope-intercept form  slope , -intercept          point-slope form  slope and any point on the line          two-point form  any two points and on the line  or    \\bottomrule     There is an advantage to slope-intercept form in that we can tell from looking at any two functions in that form whether they represent the same line. However, the other forms are sometimes easier to use based on our given information.  Let's explore the point-slope and two-point forms a bit more. The slope of a line can be interpreted as how much the line \"rises\" (increases or decreases) given a \"run\" of one unit increase in . Thus the slope can be calculated by the formula \\fbox{ } for any two points and on the line. From this we see that the two-point form of the equation of a line is the same as the point-slope form, as long as we calculate the slope from the two points ahead of time. Note that when we do that, we may use either point or to determine the equation, but we must stick with one or the other.   Finding equations of lines   Find equations for each of the linear functions described. Two lines are said to be parallel if they have the same slopes, and perpendicular if their slopes, and , are negative reciprocals of each other (meaning that or vice versa).   The line with slope that passes through the point , in slope-intercept form.    The line that passes through the points and , in slope-intercept form.    The line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line , in slope-intercept form.          Using the point-slope formula with slope and point , we get the equation . To put this equation into slope-intercept form, we just simplify: (The symbol used in the calculation above denotes that the equality to the left of the symbol logically implies the equality to the right of the symbol.)    The slope of the line through the points and is . Using this slope, the point , and the two-point formula, we get Using the point will give you the same equation in slope-intercept form after simplifying. Try it!    The line we are looking for is perpendicular to and thus has slope . Using the point-slope form with slope and point , we obtain . In slope-intercept form the equation is written .        Checking the Answer   To verify that the three linear functions we just found are reasonable, we can graph them with a graphing utility (such as Desmos). In particular, let's graph the lines (red) and (green) in part c to make sure they appear to be perpendicular:     Notice that the scales on the - and -axes are the same, so the lines correctly appear as perpendicular. Additionally, we can see that the point is on the line .      Find an equation for the line passing through that is parallel to the line . Write your answer first in point-slope form and then in slope-intercept form.      Finding -intercepts of Quadratic Functions  In this section, we develop algebraic methods for finding the -intercepts of quadratic functions. This is where the graph of the function crosses the -axis. As we can see in Figure , by shifting the graph of a quadratic function vertically, we can make its graph cross the -axis 0 times (as in the graph labeled ), exactly 1 time ( as in the graph labeled ), or twice (as in the graph labeled ). These points are the -intercepts, sometimes referred to as zeros of the graph, because these are the points where the quadratic function is equal to 0.   Three examples of quadratic functions that open up.    If we want to find the zeros of a quadratic equation, we must find the values of that make the quadratic function equal to zero, meaning we must solve solve the quadratic equation  for the variable . Some quadratic equations can be solved easily by factoring the quadratic expression . To factor an algebraic expression, you write that expression as a product of simpler expressions. There are a few different common methods for factoring that we will discuss here:    For example, the expression can be factored by recognizing that both terms share common factors of 3 and that can be un-distributed from the expression:   We can think of this factoring as \"reverse distributing.\"    Some quadratic expressions can be factored by doing the \"FOIL\" (\"First-Outside-Inside-Last\") method backwards:    For example, the expression can be factored as . Breaking this down, observe that the first terms in both and are and multiply to the . The outside terms and multiply to while the inside terms and multiply to , and that these can be added together to get . The last terms and multiply to .  Here is a good Purplemath article and here is a Khan Academy video on factoring this type of quadratic.      Factor as much as possible by working backwards (\"reverse FOILing\") to find constants and with . You may need to guess-and-check a few times to determine the answer.   Challenge: Factor as much as possible.    Differences of squares can be factored with the use of the following formula:   Formulas for Factoring Differences of Squares   For all real numbers and ,       The expression can be rewritten as , which is the difference of the square of and the square of . Thus the quadratic expression can be factored as .    There are more formulas for factoring differences of higher powers, but we won't introduce them here.  The reason that factoring can help solve an equation is that a basic property of the real numbers is that a product can be equal to zero only if one of the factors in the product is zero. In the following theorem we use the term real expressions, which will denote any expressions that when calculated are real numbers.   A Product Is Zero If and Only If One of the Factors Is Zero   For any real expressions and , if and only if or .      Returning to from Example , the real expression is a product of the real expressions and . when whereas when , and so the product when either  or .  Thus the quadratic function has zeros at and . Use the Desmos graph at  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/yayrd6etuz  to verify that crosses the -axis at and .      We can solve the quadratic equation via factoring the difference of squares as before and setting each factor equal to 0:   Thus the function has -intercepts at .     If you try to solve by adding 4 to both sides and taking the square root of both sides, you may think that there is only one solution when . For this reason, factoring is a more reliable method for solving this type of equation! We will explore why exactly we get the positive and negative square root of 4 as the solutions to in Section 1.7.   The phrase \"if and only if\" in Theorem is shorthand for saying that the implication goes both ways. The forward direction of this implication says that if is zero, then either or (or both) is zero. the backwards direction says that if or is zero, then is also zero. This theorem can be generalized to products involving more than two factors; for example, a product if and only if one or more of the factors , , , and is zero.   Warning!  Theorem applies only to equations that are set to zero, that is, equations of the form . Theorem does not say, for example, that if and only if or .    To find the solutions of the equation , we CANNOT factor the left-hand side and then set each factor equal to a divisor of . For example, the following calculation is INCORRECT:   However, when , , and when , .  The correct method is to first subtract the 4 from both sides so that the right side is 0, and then factor the left-hand side:   You should check that when either or by plugging in those values and simplifying.    Unfortunately, some quadratic expressions, such as , are not so easy to factor. If we wish to find the -values that satisfy the quadratic equation without factoring, we can apply the quadratic formula to determine the solutions.   The Quadratic Formula   If , and are real numbers, the solutions of the quadratic equation are of the form      Deriving the quadratic formula involves a process called \"completing the square\" that we aren't going to get into, but here's a good video on deriving this formula, in case you are interested.     Applying the quadratic formula to the equation , we have , , and , so the solutions are and so the quadratic function has two roots at and at . Once again, you should verify this using this Desmos graph .    The expression is called the discriminant , and it determines the number of solutions of the quadratic equation .   If is positive, then there will be two solutions: one when the symbol is a plus and one when it is a minus.    If is zero, then there is only one solution, namely, .    If is negative, then its square root is not a real number and thus the equation has no real solutions. In this case the equation does have complex-number solutions, but in this book we will be concerned only with real numbers, so a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant will be said to have \"no solutions.\"       Find the zeros (if there are any) of the quadratic functions below, either by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Use a graph to check your answers.                            Summary  The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section: linear function, linear equation, identity function, constant function, quadratic function, quadratic equation, parameter, function with parameter; -intercept, zero of a function, -intercept, positive (and negative), increasing (and decreasing), local maximum (and minimum), global maximum (and minimum), concave up (and concave down), inflection point; extrema, conjecture; slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and two-point form of a line; parallel, perpendicular; real expressions, difference of squares, quadratic formula, discriminant  Key ideas: Linear and quadratic functions can be written in the forms and , respectively, for particular values of the parameters , and . There are alternate forms for the equations of a line that can be useful. There are many methods for factoring quadratic equations and finding the -intercepts of a quadratic function, including using the Quadratic Formula.   Other ideas introduced: Families of functions can have similar properties that change depending on the values of the parameters of the function. We wish to develop algebraic methods for determining the properties of functions so we do not have to rely on computer-generated graphs.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.2}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "body": " Average Rate of Change    Functions Average Rate of Change     Learning Goals    Learn the formula for average rate of change and be able to use it to calculate the average rate of change of a function on an interval.    Visualize average rate of change on the graph of a function.    See how the idea of average rate of change can be useful in some applied contexts.    Understand the units for average rate of change in the context of a mathematical model.    Compare the average rate of change of a linear function and a quadratic function.    Revisit the idea of concavity in terms of average rate of change.      Definition of Average Rate of Change of a Function  In the previous section, we looked at linear and quadratic functions in some depth. We now know that each type of function has a predictable shape. In particular, linear function have a constant slope, while quadratic functions do not. Another way to say this is that linear functions change at a constant rate. In this section, we learn one way to describe how functions change when they do not increase or decrease at a constant rate.     below shows the height of the winning pole vault at the Olympics  The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 2005 ,p. 866 (New York). As found in Applied Calculus by Hughes Hallet et al. during the 1960s and more recently. Find the rate of change of the winning height between 1960 and 1968, and between 2008 and 2016. In which of these two periods did the height increase faster?   Winning height in men's Olympic pole vault (approximate)    \\toprule Year  1960  1964  1968  \\ldots  2008  2012  2016    \\midrule Height (cm)  470  510  540  \\ldots  596  597  603    \\bottomrule       To compare the 1960s and the more recent period, we calculate the average change over each time period, similar to how we calculate the slope of a line as :    Thus, on average, the height was increasing more quickly during the 1960s.    The data in does not have a constant rate of change (it is not linear). However, we can compute an average rate of change over any interval. The word average is used because the rate of change may vary within the interval.  In general, given a function that models a certain phenomenon, it's natural to ask such questions as \"how is the function changing on a given interval\" or \"on which interval is the function changing more rapidly?\" The concept of average rate of change enables us to make these questions more mathematically precise.  We use the symbol (the Greek letter capital delta) to mean \"change in,\" so means \"change in and means \"change in y.\" The average rate of change of a dependent quantity is then expressed as a fraction of the change in the dependent variable divided by the amount of change in the independent variable:   Average Rate of Change   If is a function of , so , then . The units of average rate of change of a function are units of per units of .  We will often abbreviate the average rate of change on the interval as     The quantity is called a difference quotient because it is the quotient of two differences. This formula may look familiar to you; it resembles the formula we use in to compute the slope of the line between two points. As we will explore later, the average rate of change of a function on an interval can be visualized as the slope of the line from to .    For example, the function graphed below in is increasing until , decreasing from to , increasing again from until , and then decreasing after .   A function that both increases and decreases.    The function is not linear and so has no \"slope.\" In order to discuss how much it increases or decreases, we can look at each interval separately.  On the interval , we calculate the average rate of change of between and . First, we observe that and in order to use these quantities in the formula for Average Rate of Change with and : and so we see that, on average, the function is changing by units of per unit of between and . We could also say that the function is decreasing by 2 units of per unit of , which matches what we see in the picture.  Similarly, we calculate the average rate of change of on the interval . Observe that and will be used in the formula for Average Rate of Change, using and : so, on average, the function is increasing by 1 unit of per unit of between and .  We can also measure average rate of change over intervals where the function both increases and decreases. For example, on the interval the function first decreases and then increases. Note that and . Computing the average rate of change from to : so, on average, the function is decreasing by 1 (or changing by ) unit of per unit of between and .  As another example, the average rate of change on the interval is where we observe that since and , the function has not changed on average from to .      What is another interval where the function pictured above in has an average rate of change of 0?      Average Change of a Linear Function  Let's examine the average change of linear functions using the function . Before we begin and without doing any calculations, think about what the average change of a line should be.  Now let's compute the average change of on three different, random intervals: , , and . Before reading the calculations below, you should evaluate the values of at each of the endpoints of the intervals ( , and ) to make following it less confusing. .    We notice that we have gotten the same average change of for all three intervals. We wonder if this is a coincidence. In order to confirm that this is not a coincidence, we calculate the average change of on any interval :   So now we have confirmed that the average rate of change of on any interval is , which is the same as the slope .  There was nothing special about this function. The average change of any linear function on any interval is the slope of the function. In fact, we may take this to be the definition of a linear function, if we want:   Alternate Definition of a Linear Function   A function is linear provided that its average rate of change is constant on every choice of interval in its domain.      Let be given by the data in the table     Determine , and for the function . Could be a linear function?      Visualizing Average Rate of Change  So far we have practiced using the formula for average rate of change from a graph, function, and table. We also established that the average rate of change of a line is its slope. In this section, we connect these two ideas: \\fbox{The average rate of change of a function on an interval can be visualized as the slope of the line between the points and . }  Visualizing Average Rate of Change as Slope   Calculate the average rate of change of the function (a) on the interval and (b) on the interval . Then (c) illustrate these average rates of change graphically.       To find the average change on , first we compute and . Now using the formula, we have .    To find the average change on , let's first compute that and . Using the formula again, we have .    Graphically, the two average rates we found can be represented as slopes of line segments, as follows:  The slope between and is 2. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\caption{The slope between and is .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{The average rate of change can be visualized as slope.}          Copy the graph from Example on to your paper and visualize the average change on , and as the slope of the line between the endpoints of each interval (one line for each interval). Make sure these appear to be reasonable based on the calculated average rates of change in Example .   The graph from Example \\xautoref{ex_avgchange1}.        Average Change in Context  Let's now return to the question of describing the rate of change of a quantity in context, paying special attention to the units and interpretation for these calculations.    Let the height function for a ball tossed vertically be given by , where is measured in seconds since the ball was thrown and is measured in feet above the ground.  Plotting the function using Desmos in , it looks like the ball is thrown from a height of 48 feet, reaches its maximum height of 64 feet after 1 second, and hits the ground after 3 seconds:   The function graphed with key points labeled.    The average rate of change of on the interval is calculated below, using the fact that and :   According to Definition , the units for the average rate of change of should be \"units of per units of .\" Since the units of are feet and the units of are seconds, the units for are \"feet per second.\" In the context of the ball, this means that from 1.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds after the ball is thrown, it falls at an average speed of 32 feet per second toward the ground.  We can visualize the quantity as the slope of the line connecting the points and on the graph of :       In the context of a function that measures height or position of a moving object at a given time, such as in Example , the meaning of the average rate of change of the function on a given interval is the average velocity of the moving object because it is the ratio of change in position to change in time:   For example, in Exercise , the units on are \"feet per second\" since the units on the numerator are \"feet\" and on the denominator \"seconds.\" The fact that the average rate of change is negative in this example indicates that the ball is falling. In every situation, the units on the average rate of change help us interpret its meaning, and those units are always \"units of output per unit of input.\"  Here is another context in which we consider an average rate of change:    According to the US census, the populations of Kent and Ottawa Counties in Michigan from 1960 to 2010, measured in -year intervals are given in the following tables.  Kent County population data.   Ottawa county population data.   Let represent the population of Kent County in year and the population of Ottawa County in year .   Compute for both and .    What are the units on each of the quantities you computed in part a?    Write a careful sentence that explains the meaning of the average rate of change of the Ottawa county population on the time interval . Your sentence should begin something like ``In an average year between 1990 and 2010, the population of Ottawa County was ...\"    Which county had a greater average rate of change during the time interval ? Were there any intervals in which one of the counties had a negative average rate of change?    Using the given data, what do you predict will be the population of Ottawa County in 2018? Why?       If you have time, attempt the questions yourself, then read the solutions below.   For , we have . For , we have .    Population is measured in people, time here is measured in years. So, the units are people per year.    In an average year between 1990 and 2010, the population of Ottawa County was increasing by about people per year.    Between 2000 and 2010, the Kent County population increased by about people per year, and the Ottawa County population increased by about people per year. So, Kent county had a greater average rate of change. Since the populations always increase from one decade to the next, neither county has an interval with a negative average rate of change.    The average rate of change between and in Ottawa county is people per year; if we assume this holds over the next years, then in the total population will be: people years people per year people.       The average rate of change of a function on an interval gives us an excellent way to describe how the function behaves, on average. For instance, if we compute for Kent County, we find that , which tells us that in an average year from 1970 to 2000, the population of Kent County increased by about 5443 people. Said differently, we could also say that from 1970 to 2000, Kent County was growing at an average rate of 5443 people per year. These ideas also afford the opportunity to make comparisons over time. Since , we can not only say that Kent County's population increased by about 7370 in an average year between 1990 and 2000, but also that the population was growing faster from 1990 to 2000 than it did from 1970 to 2000.  Finally, we can even use the average rate of change of a function to predict future behavior. Since the population was changing on average by 7370.5 people per year from 1990 to 2000, we can estimate that the population in 2002 is .  This of course assumes that the average increase in population during the next two years remains the same as it has been in the past 10 years.    Concavity and Average Change of a Quadratic Function  In contrast to linear functions, quadratic functions do not have a constant rate of change. Instead, their rates of change follow a different pattern. We'll begin to see this pattern by looking at the graphs of functions whose rates of change are increasing throughout an interval or decreasing throughout an interval.   below shows graphs that are concave up: they are bending upward because the rate of change of the function is increasing.   An increasing, concave up function. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\caption{A decreasing, concave up function.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Graphs that are concave up. Their rates of change are increasing.}  On the other hand, below shows graphs that are concave down: they are bending downward because the rate of change of the function is decreasing.   An increasing, concave down function. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.2\\textwidth} \\caption{A decreasing, concave down function.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Graphs that are concave down. Their rates of change are decreasing.}  We know that quadratic functions are always either concave up or concave down, so we can expect their rates of change to increase (if the quadratic function in concave up) or for them to decrease (if the quadratic function is concave down). Note that a line is neither concave up nor concave down, and its rate of change is constant.  Here is an example in the context of a falling object to help us look even further into what pattern rates of change of quadratic functions follow:    Suppose a water balloon is tossed vertically from a fifth story window. Its height, , in meters, at time , in seconds, is modeled by the function .  Below is a table for values of average rates of change for on select intervals. Can you spot a pattern?   Average rates of change for on several unit-length intervals        \\midrule  m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     In Table we see an interesting pattern in the average velocities of the ball: they decrease by exactly 10 m\/s on each subsequent unit-length interval. Indeed, if we remove the endpoint of each interval and focus on the starting value of each interval, viewing the resulting average rate of change as a function of the starting value, we may consider the related table, Table seen below:   Data from Table , recast with average velocity as a function of the starting point of the interval        \\midrule  m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     We observe that the average rate of change of is decreasing by 10 m\/s for each second that passes. It is itself changing in a way that seems to be represented by a linear function. Thus it appears that the average rate of change is a linear function of . Moreover, we can also visualize the concave down quadratic function and its decreasing average rates of change. The picture below graphs these average rates of change as slope on each interval, and we can see that the slopes of the lines on each interval are getting more and more negative (from to , then , etc.).       While it takes key ideas from calculus to formalize this observation, for now we will simply note that for a quadratic function, there seems to be a related linear function that tells us something about how the quadratic function changes.    Summarize the difference between average rates of change for linear and quadratic functions.      Summary  The following terms, symbols, and formulas were introduced in this section:  meaning \"change in,\" average rate of change of a function on an interval, difference quotient, average velocity.  Key ideas: The average rate of change of a function on an intervals describes how much, on average, that function is increasing or decreasing on the interval. Linear functions have constant average rate of change. Quadratic functions do not have a constant average rate of change. Average rate of change can be visualized as slope between points on the graph. The units for average rate of change are units of output per unit of input.   Other ideas introduced: Functions that are concave up have increasing rates of change while functions that are concave down have decreasing rates of change. Quadratic functions have rates of change that appear to be changing linearly.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.3}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "body": " Modeling with Linear and Quadratic Functions    Functions Modeling     Learning Goals    Examine the mathematical modeling cycle.    Use linear and quadratic functions to describe real-world problems.    Practice translating back and forth between the context and mathematical calculations in a problem.    Revisit ideas of domain and range, increasing and decreasing, intercepts, and average rate of change in a context that gives these concepts a practical meaning.      The Mathematical Modeling Process  A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.   below illustrates the process of mathematical modeling.   The modeling cycle. Graphic from www.educationaldesigner.org .    Given a real-world problem, our first task is to formulate a mathematical problem by   identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables    making assumptions that simplify the problem so it is easy enough to describe with mathematics    using knowledge of the physical situation to brainstorm relevant equations, formulas, and theorems, possibly working from data or a graph    obtaining equations that relate the variables     The second step is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that we will be developing over the year) to the mathematical equations that we have formulated in order to derive a mathematical solution.  In the third step, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don't compare well with reality, we need to refine our model or formulate a new model and start the cycle over again.  This is similar to the framework for problem-solving described in , except that in a truly real-world problem, the actual question may not be stated explicitly or formulated in a way that can be answered without further refinement of the question (getting more information, simplifying more assumptions, building more theory). Since we are working in the context of a calculus course, all of our \"real-world\" questions will be very well-behaved and tractable.  A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation. Instead, it is an idealization or an approximation . A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to realize the limitations of the model.    Using Linear Functions as Models  Since linear functions have a constant slope, linear functions perfectly model quantities that change at a constant rate. In context, we can often think of slope as a rate of change. Paying careful attention to units can help determine whether given information is a value of a variable or a rate of change.   Dolbear's Law   One example of a mathematical model is found in Dolbear's Law. You can read more in the Wikipedia entry for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets. For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, see this article . In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature. If we let represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.   Data for Dolbear's observations    \\toprule (chirps per minute)  40  80  120  160    \\midrule ( Fahrenheit)        \\bottomrule     For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed. When we graph the data, we can see a pattern that tells us what kind of formula to use:   Graph of Dolbear's data and the underlying curve.    The data appear to fit a line. If we calculate the average rate of change between any two points, this should give us the slope of the line. Using the points and , we find .  Using point-slope form with the point You could use the point instead, or any of the other points.  and simplifying to slope-intercept form, we have   Before we attempt any further calculations, we may want to check that our model accurately represents the collected data. Let's check that the point is indeed on the line. For , we have   Success! Now that we have found a formula, and convinced ourselves that it's correct, If you are not convinced yet, think about how you could further verify that this model is accurate. let's give it a name. Let be the name of our \"Dolbear\" function that takes number of chirps per minute as inputs and gives temperature in degrees Fahrenheit as outputs:  \\fbox{ Dolbear's function, , models the relationship between the number of cricket chirps per minute and the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.}      Now that we have a model for Dolbear's observations, let's use it to make some predictions.   If we hear snowy tree crickets chirping at a rate of 92 chirps per minute, what does Dolbear's model suggest should be the outside temperature?    If the outside temperature is F, how many chirps per minute should we expect to hear?    Suppose that in the morning an observer hears 65 chirps per minute, and several hours later hears 75 chirps per minute. How much has the temperature risen between observations?        More about Dolbear's Law   Let's continue to explore the limits of our model for Dolber's observations. Suppose we wish to know the number of chirps we should hear when the outside temperature is F. There is no point on the graph with and so we solve numerically for to determine the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is F.   So we see that . In context, this means that when it's outside, we should hear chirps per minute. A negative number of chirps per minute does not make sense, and so we can see that the model is not valid when the outside temperature is F.  At this point in the modeling process, a scientist would need to revisit the physical situation and make further observations. Indeed, Dolbear observed that temperatures below F are too cold for the crickets and temperatures above F are too hot for the crickets, so the model is only accurate for temperatures between F and F. What is the fewest number of chirps per minute an observer could expect to hear? The greatest number of chirps per minute?  From the original observations in , we can see that . Using the algebraic function, we can compute so that . Thus we can expect to observe between 40 and 180 chirps per minute for temperatures between F and F. Note that we are using our understanding of the shape of linear functions here: this is an increasing linear function, so the values of the outputs increase steadily with the values of the inputs.     When working with a model, it is common to have to restrict the domain of a function based on real-world conditions, rather than algebraic requirements, so that the model makes sense in the context it is meant to represent.   Here is another physical phenomenon where a linear function provides an appropriate model: measuring the area of a glacier over time. Remember: linear functions have constant average rates of change, so are ideal for modeling quantities that change at a constant rate.   Modeling Glacier Areas   The summit of Africa's largest peak, Mt. Kilimanjaro, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak. Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 ( ) to be approximately m ; in the year 2007, the ice cover measured m .   Suppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year. Find a linear model whose output is the area, in square meters in year (where is the number of years after 2000).    What do the slope and -intercept mean in the model you found in (a)? In particular, what are the units on the slope?    Compute . What does this quantity measure? Write a complete sentence to explain.    If the model holds further into the future, when do we predict the ice cover will vanish?    In light of your work above, what is a reasonable domain to use for the model ? What is the corresponding range?       If you have time, work through the example on your own first, then read the solution below.   We are told that the ice cover starts at , so the point lies on the graph of the function. We are also given the point . The slope is then The linear model is then .    The slope is the rate at which the glacier is losing ice each year, measured in m \/year. The -intercept is the area of the ice at (in 2000).     . In 2017, the ice cover on the glacier is approximately 989.2857 m .    The ice cover will vanish when . Solving for , we have . The ice cover will vanish toward the end of May of 2034.    A reasonable domain for the model is . The corresponding range is , meaning the ice cover will take on values between 1951 m and 0 m . (Note that we still write this interval as 0 to 1951 when using interval notation, even though the ice cover is vanishing.)         What is a quantity or phenomenon that you observe to have a constant rate of change? Assign names to the independent and dependent variables and create a linear model of this phenomenon. If relevant, include an appropriate domain and\/or range. Is your model an increasing or decreasing linear function?      Modeling with Quadratic Functions: Falling Objects  One of the reasons that quadratic functions are so important is because of a physical fact of the universe we inhabit: for an object only being influenced by gravity, acceleration due to gravity is constant . If we measure time in seconds and a rising or falling object's height in feet, the gravitational constant is feet per second per second, where the negative sign signifies that gravity is pulling \"down,\" meaning toward the ground.  One of the fantastic consequences of calculus which, like the realization that acceleration due to gravity is constant, is largely due to Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s is that the height of a falling object at time is modeled by a quadratic function.   Height of an object falling under the force of gravity   For an object tossed vertically from an initial height of feet with a velocity of feet per second, the object's height at time (in seconds) is given by the formula and corresponds to a gravitational constant of ft\/s .  If height is measured instead in meters and velocity in meters per second, the gravitational constant is m\/s and the function has form .    We will see where this formula comes from later in the course!    A water balloon is tossed vertically from a dorm room window at an initial height of 37 feet with an initial velocity of 41 feet per second. We can use Theorem to model the height of the water balloon. First, we notice that since the information is given in feet and seconds, we should use the formula corresponding to a gravitational constant of ft\/s . Next, we determine the constants in the formula. The initial height in the problem is given as 37 feet, so we have .  The initial velocity is given as 41 feet per second. Note the units! This is the rate of change of position. Thus we have .  Thus our model is where is measured in seconds, denotes the time at which the water balloon is thrown, and is measured in feet.  Now that we have our model, let's answer some questions. First, let's determine the time that the water balloon hits the ground. At that time, the height will be 0, so our mathematical task is to solve for , noting that we would like to have a positive time since our model only becomes valid after . That quadratic equation does not look like it will factor nicely, so we will immediately use the quadratic formula:   Since we are looking for a time after the balloon is thrown, the answer we are looking for is   This implies a domain for our model since the balloon cannot pass through the ground: the model gives the height of the water balloon seconds after it is thrown until it hits the ground, so for .  Lastly, let's graph our function and use that to estimate the time the water balloon reaches its highest point, along with its height at that time. This will give us the range of our model, as well.   The function that models the height of the water balloon for .    From the Desmos graph, we can see that the quadratic function reaches its maximum at approximately the point . (We can also check that our model has the correct vertical intercept and that our computation for when the balloon hits the ground is correct.) The range of our model is . Interpreting this information back into the context of the balloon, we can say that the balloon reaches its highest point approximately second after it is thrown, and that its height is feet at that time.     One of our main goals this semester will be to develop algebraic methods with which to answer this last question of when and where a maximum occurs. But we need calculus in order to do that.     Use the model developed in Example to answer the following questions. Recall the formula from Section for the Average Rate of Change of a function on an interval :    Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . What are the units for the number you computed?    Copy the graph of from to your notes. Draw an appropriate line on the graph whose slope is the value of the average rate of change in part (a).    You should have computed in part (a) and be able to see in part (b) that the average rate of change of on the interval is negative. Does this mean that the balloon is falling between and ?    Compute the average rate of change of on the interval . Is the balloon speeding up or slowing down as it approaches the ground?         Cost, Revenue, and Profit  In this section, we look at some of the functions of interest to decision-makers in a firm or industry.   The Cost Function   The cost function , gives the total cost of producing a quantity of some good.    What sort of function do you expect to be? The more goods that are made, the higher the total cost, so is an increasing function. Costs of production can be separated into two parts: the fixed costs, which are incurred even if nothing is produced, and the variable costs, which depend on how many units are produced.    Let's consider a company that makes radios. The factory and machinery needed to begin production are fixed costs, which are incurred even if no radios are made. The costs of labor and raw materials are variable costs since these quantities depend on how many radios are made. The fixed costs for this company are $24,000 and the variable costs are $7 per radio. Then so, if is the number of radios produced, . This is the equation of a line with slope 7 and vertical intercept of 24,000!    The variable cost for one additional unit is called the marginal cost . For a linear cost function, the marginal cost is the rate of change, or slope, of the cost function.    In each case, draw a graph of a linear cost function satisfying the given conditions:   Fixed costs are large but marginal cost is small.    There are no fixed costs but marginal cost is high.        The Revenue Function   The revenue function , , gives the total revenue received by a firm from selling a quantity, of some good.    If the goods sell for a price of per unit, and the quantity sold is , then . If the price does not depend on the quantity sold, so is a constant, the graph of revenue as a function of is a line through the origin, with slope equal to the price .    If radios sell for $15 each, then the manufacturer's revenue function is       Graph the cost function and the revenue function on the same axes. For what values of does the company make money?    The company makes money whenever revenues are greater than costs, so we find the values of for which the graph of lies above the graph of :     We find the point at which the graph of and cross:   The company makes a profit if it produces and sells more than 3000 radios. The company loses money if it produces and sells fewer than 3000 radios.    This difference between the revenue and cost is called profit , and many decisions are made based on this quantity, rather than cost or revenue alone:   The Profit Function   The profit function , written as to distinguish it from the price, , is the difference   The break-even point for a company is the point where the profit is zero and revenue equals cost.      For our radio manufacturer, a formula for the profit function is   Notice that the negative of the fixed cost is the vertical intercept and the break-even point is the horizontal intercept when we graph in :   Profit for the radio manufacturer.        If cost, , and revenue, , are given by the graph below, what is the break-even point for the company? For what production quantities does the firm make a profit?       Just as we used the term marginal cost to mean the rate of change, or slope, of a linear cost function, we use the terms marginal revenue and marginal profit to mean the rate of change, or slope, of linear revenue and profit functions, respectively. The term marginal is used because we are looking at how the cost, revenue, or profit change \"at the margin,\" that is, by the addition of one more unit.    For example, for the radio manufacturer, the marginal cost is 7 dollars\/item (the additional cost of producing one more item is $7), the marginal revenue is 15 dollars\/item (the additional revenue from selling one more item is $15), and the marginal profit is 8 dollars\/item (the additional profit from selling one more item is $8).      How is the idea of a \"marginal\" cost, revenue, or profit similar to the idea of the average rate of change of a function?      Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: mathematical model, height of a falling object, cost function, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, revenue function, profit function, break-even point, marginal revenue, marginal profit.  Key ideas: Linear and quadratic functions are extremely useful for modeling real-world phenomena. Properties of functions and average rate of change have meaningful interpretations in such contexts.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.4}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "body": " Polynomial and Rational Functions    Functions Polynomial Functions  Functions Quadratic Functions     Learning Goals    Learn the definition of polynomial and rational functions.    Understand how zeros of polynomial functions correspond to linear factors.    Review the rules for fractions.    Discover how to find the domain of a rational functions.    Take a first look at the graphical properties of rational functions at points where they are undefined.    So far we have looked at linear and quadratic functions. Now we will expand to larger categories of functions, called polynomial and rational functions. These functions are much more complicated, both in appearance and in their properties.    Definition of Polynomial Functions    Here are some examples of polynomials:            Some things that we notice: there can be many terms added together in a polynomial, rather than just one, two, or three, but there cannot be an unlimited number of terms added together. Each term is either constant or a number times a power of . The power of is always a positive whole number, though the numbers in front of the 's may be decimals. Here is another way of saying this exact same thing using more formal mathematical language: A polynomial function is a finite sum of terms of the form where is some real number and is any nonnegative integer (meaning ). The following definition provides a general notation for writing down an arbitrary polynomial, in much the same way that is an arbitrary linear function and is an arbitrary quadratic function (those are also both polynomials). Since we may have many many terms, we use indices for the parameters , etc. in front of the powers of , and it's convenient to have the index match the power:   Polynomial Functions   A polynomial function is a function that can be written in the form for some integer and some real numbers with . The integer is called the degree of the polynomial, and is the largest power of that appears in the polynomial.     As a matter of convention, we also say that the constant zero function is a polynomial function (and that its degree is undefined).   The parameters are called the coefficients of the polynomial. The subscripts on the coefficients are called indices (a single one is called an index ) and are a way of labeling lots of different parameters without running out of letters. Note that the coefficient belonging to the term containing the power is conveniently named . For example, the coefficient of the term is called . Each of the coefficients represents a single real number. There are no restrictions on what the coefficients could be equal to, but if we want the highest power of in the polynomial to be (so that the degree is ), then we need that coefficient, labeled to not be zero. The coefficient belonging to the highest power of is called the leading coefficient , and the term containing the highest power of with is called the leading term . The coefficient is called the constant term.     For the polynomial , determine the leading coefficient, leading term, degree, constant term, and coefficients and .    We can expand as   From this, we can see that the leading coefficient is 3, the leading term is , the degree is 4, the constant term is 0, the coefficient of is and so is equal to 4, and the coefficient of is and so is equal to .      For the polynomial , determine the leading coefficient, leading term, degree, constant term, and coefficients and .    We have special names for some polynomials according to their degrees. For example, polynomials of degree 0 are called constant , of degree 1 are called linear , of degree 2 are called quadratic , of degree 3 are called cubic , of degree 4 are called quartic , and of degree 5 are called quintic polynomials. (Note: We require non-zero leading coefficients for quadratics and higher degrees, but not for linear functions; in other words, we will consider constant functions to be linear as we did in .)    The Structure of Polynomial Functions: Factors and Zeros  Higher degrees often result in more -intercepts, a.k.a. zeros, and more local minima and maxima in the graph of a polynomial.    Examine the cubic, quartic, and quintic polynomials in Figure below.   A cubic (left), quartic (middle), and quintic (right) polynomial and their graphs.    The cubic polynomial on the left has three -intercepts at , and . Note that we can see this from the factored form of by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for : .  The quartic polynomial in the middle also has three -intercepts , and . When factored, , and we can see that the -intercept comes from setting the factor equal to 0, while and come from and , respectively.  The quintic polynomial on the right has four zeros: , and . When factored, and we can see that each factor corresponds to an -intercept again.  Note that has one local minimum and one local maximum. has two local minima and one local maxima, and that the local minimum at is also a global minimum. has two local maxima and two local minima.    You may be wondering if there is a pattern or rule in the number of -intercepts and local minima\/maxima that a polynomial function has. It turns out that, yes, there is, but it is more complicated than our observations of linear and quadratic functions. There is a very powerful theorem (called The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ) that says that every polynomial function can be factored into linear factors and\/or irreducible quadratic factors. Each of the linear factors corresponds to an -intercept.  A quadratic expression is irreducible if it cannot be factored with real-number coefficients; that is is irreducible if it cannot be written in the form for some real numbers and . Since each factor would correspond to an -intercept:  a quadratic expression is irreducible if the equation has no solution. We already know that the equation has no solution if the discriminant is negative, so we know that a quadratic expression is irreducible if and only if its discriminant is negative    For example, the quadratic expression is irreducible. We can rewrite in order to see that and then compute the discriminant:   Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic expression is irreducible. It does not factor and we can see graphically that it does not have any zeros:   The graph of has no -intercepts.        Show that and are irreducible, first by computing their discriminants, then by graphing and observing that they are never equal to zero.    \\fbox{ Note that every linear factor of a polynomial corresponds to an -intercept of that polynomial, since if a polynomial can be factored as for some other polynomial (meaning, if is a factor of ), then and thus is an -intercept of . The converse is also true: if is an -intercept of , then has linear factor : for some other polynomial . }}    The polynomials in Figure on the previous page have already been factored for us. We can see that the cubic polynomial has three -intercepts. The -intercept at corresponds to the linear factor . The -intercept at corresponds to the linear factor . The -intercept at corresponds to the linear factor .  Note that also has three -intercept, despite being a fourth-degree polynomial. This is because there are two linear factors with the same -intercept of since the factorization of includes .  The quintic (degree-five) polynomial has four -intercepts, again with a double- -intercept at corresponding to the linear factor .    When a linear factor occurs more than once in the factorization of a polynomial , we say that has a repeated zero at . We say that repeated zeros are double zeros if the factorization includes , triple zeros if the factorization includes , and so on, according to the number of times the factor is repeated.    For example, the function has a double zero at and the polynomial has a triple zero at and a quadruple zero at . Notice in the graphs of these functions that there is some interesting behavior at the repeated zero:     In the first figure, the graph of does not go straight through the -axis at the double zero ; instead, it bounces off, much like a concave-down parabola. In the second graph, the triple zero at behaves like the graph of near its -intercept and the quadruple zero behaves like the graph of next its -intercept. This phenomenon happens in general: a zero repeated -times as a linear factor is graphically similar to the graph of near its -intercept.    The next theorem describes some key graphical properties of polynomial functions. The second part of Theorem is related to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, and the proof of this deep theorem is far, far beyond the score of this course. We will prove the third part after we learn more about derivatives.   Graphical Properties of Polynomial Functions   If is a polynomial function of degree , then the graph of    has domain     has at most real roots.    has at most local minima\/maxima; which we will call turning points          Give formulas and graphs for three cubic polynomials: one with three distinct real zeros, one with two distinct real zeros, and one with only one real, non-repeated, zero.    To construct a cubic polynomial with three distinct real zeros we simply multiply together three distinct linear factors, as shown in the picture below at the left. To obtain exactly two distinct zeros we can make one of our factors repeated, as in the middle picture. Finally, to have only one zero that is not repeated, we can multiply a linear factor and an irreducible quadratic factor, since irreducible quadratic factors do not have any real zeros; see the right-most picture. Note that the left and middle pictures both have two turning points, while the third picture has none.   Three cubic polynomials with one, two, and three distinct zeros, from right to left, respectively.      However, just because a polynomial has a factorization doesn't mean that we have an easy way to actually factor that polynomial! In general, factoring a polynomial is extremely hard, and is often impossible; there is no mathematical formula for finding the zeros of polynomials of degree 5 and higher. It's not that nobody has found such a formula yet. It has actually been proven as mathematical fact that it is impossible to find such a formula. How would you even prove that something is impossible? Mathematics can! The only \"manageable\" formulas for factoring higher-degree polynomials are generalizations of the \"difference of squares\" formula from :   Formulas for Factoring Differences of Powers   For all real numbers and , and any positive integer ,       The sixth-degree polynomial can first factor as a difference of squares: and then we can factor the cubic polynomial using the above formula for the difference of cubes:   The factorization is the best that we can do with our current methods, though the cubic factor does have a zero and can be reduced (we just don't know how).  Note that we also could have used the formula for 6-degree differences first and gotten but then we do not know how to factor the resulting degree-five polynomial. As we already mentioned, factoring is a seriously non-trivial mathematical endeavor. This could be another Expansion Project, if you are very interested in knowing how to do it. Just ask.       In Example , we factored as much as we are able. Verify that is irreducible (use the discriminant) and does not factor further. Then graph and estimate the location of its zero . This tells us that has another linear factor of that we could not find directly via factoring.      Rules for Fractions  In the next subsection, we will define rational functions. Because the word \"rational\" means that we will be working with fractions, before we talk about rational functions, we must recall some rules for adding, multiplying, and dividing fractions.   Algebraic Rules for Fractions   Let , and be any real numbers. Then (assuming that no denominator in any expression is zero)    Adding Fractions:       Multiplying Fractions:       Dividing Fractions:         You can also add fractions by forming the lowest common denominator.    We can calcuate using the formula above: but it is easier to convert to a common denominator of 6 instead:     The following are some more useful rules that are consequences of Theorem , meaning that you can manage just using the rules in Theorem , but these are convenient to remember as well.   More Algebraic Rules for Fractions   Let , and be any real numbers. Then (assuming that no denominator in any expression is zero)    Subtracting Fractions:       Multiplying a Fraction by a Number:       Dividing a Fraction by a Number:       Dividing a Number by a Fraction:           Which of the rules for fractions in Theorem and Theorem are familiar to you? Which are new to you? Pick one rule that is new to you and give an example using it with numbers. Check your work by plugging both sides into a calculator.      Definition of Rational Functions  A rational number is a number that can be written as a quotient (a.k.a. fraction) of the simplest possible numbers you can imagine, namely, integers. For example, and . Similarly, a rational function is a quotient of simpler functions, namely, polynomials.   Rational Functions are Quotients of Polynomials   A rational function is a function that can be written as the quotient of two polynomial functions for any such that .    Just like our previous definitions for functions, the key realization is that a rational function can be written in such a form. It does not have to begin that way.    We rewrite the function as a rational function by finding a common denominator, adding fractions, then simplifying:   Thus we see that is rational because it can be written as a fraction of the polynomial divided by the polynomial .      Use the rules for fractions in Theorem and Theorem to write the following function in the form of a rational function, that is, in the form where and are polynomial functions.   Begin by subtracting the fractions in the numerator, then divide by the denominator using Theorem part (c).      Domain and Zeros of Rational Functions  Remember that we cannot divide by 0. Using this idea, we can see from Definition that the domain of a rational function is all -values that are not zeros of the denominator of that function.    Let's find the domains of , , and .  The domain of is . We can write this using interval notation as .  The domain of is . We can write this using interval notation as .  The domain of is . We can write this using interval notation as .      Find the domain of .    We know that the domain of a rational function is all -values that are not zeros of the denominator. Thus we set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for , which will give us the -values to exclude from the domain.  Factoring, we have when and so when .  Thus the domain is since those are the -values where the denominator is equal to 0. Using interval notation we can write the domain as     What do the graphs of rational functions look like? They can be very interesting, especially because as we get close to -values that are not in the domain of the function, we are getting close to a point where we are dividing by 0. However, graphs of rational functions are highly dependent on small changes in their numerators and denominators. Pay careful attention to the details in the next example, especially the number of times that each linear factor is repeated in the numerator and\/or denominator:    What is the domain of the three following rational functions? What do the graphs look like near the -values that are not in the domain?     The domain of all three functions is since in all three functions, and are the zeros of the denominator. However, we can see that the functions have very different properties at and . and have a vertical asymptote at and a hole at . On the other hand, has vertical asymptotes at both and . We will look at some of the reasons for these here, but we will have to leave the details to explore later when we develop our language of limits .    The reason why and above have a hole at instead of a vertical asymptote is related to the following theorem:   Cancellation when Variables are Involved   Given any real expression that depends on a variable ,       For example, if you can cancel a common factor from the numerator and denominator of a fraction, the cancelled expression will equal the original expression for all values of  except  . One illustration of this theorem is the cancellation       In Example , the function has a hole at instead of a zero or vertical asymptote because algebraically, we can cancel the common :   Thus the graph of in Example looks identical to the graph of  except at the point where is undefined. We represent this undefined point on the graph with a hole.    The next theorem tells us when a quotient can be equal to zero. This theorem will help us solve equations that can be written as quotients.   When Is a Quotient Equal to Zero?   If and are any real expressions, then if and only if and .      For example, the function in Example does not have a zero at , even though its numerator is equal to zero when , even after canceling:   Because the original denominator of the function is zero when , the function is forever undefined at .    \\fbox{Note in particular that does not imply that .  In fact, if , then is undefined. That is why we require not only that but also that .  Note also that Theorem is valid only for equations that are set to zero. }}    Find the zeros of the function .    As we saw in Example , the domain of the function is found by setting the denominator equal to zero. According to Theorem , we find the zeros by setting the numerator equal to zero, and also checking that the denominator is not equal to zero.  The numerator is and .  We already found in Example that the denominator is equal to zero for , and so is not equal to zero when .  Thus the only zero of is at .      Find the domain of the function . What are the zeros, if any, of ?    The domain of is where the denominator , so .  The zeros of are where the numerator  and the denominator . Using the difference of squares,   But we already know that the denominator is 0 when , so the only zero of the function is       Graph the functions and using Desmos. Verify the zeros found in Example and Example are correct. Do the functions have vertical asymptotes or holes at their non-domain points? Note that Desmos will not automatically display an empty circle if there is a hole on a graph. However, if you try to evaluate the function at the point, it will tell you it is undefined.       Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: polynomial function, degree, coefficient, leading coefficient, leading term, constant term; cubic, quartic, quintic polynomial; irreducible quadratic, repeated zero, double zero, triple zero; turning point; vertical asymptote, hole.  Key ideas: Linear factors of a polynomial function correspond to zeros, and a polynomial function of degree can have at most zeros. Rational functions are undefined where their denominators are equal to zero. They have zeros where their numerators are equal to zero, provided that the denominator is not also equal to zero.   Other ideas introduced: Polynomial functions of degree can have at most turning points. Rational functions can have either vertical asymptotes or holes at points where they are undefined. Factoring is really hard and often impossible for higher-degree polynomials.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.5}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

Your final answer should include only positive exponents.                            Definitions of Power Functions    A power function is a function that can be written in the form for some nonzero real number and some rational number .    For example, , , and are all power functions. Note that can be rewritten in the form , which is why it is a power function (with and ).  In this definition, the constant is called the power or exponent , and the constant is called the coefficient . Note that the exponent must be a rational number . A rational number is a real number that can be written as a quotient of the form for some integers and with . The variable must be in the base; this means that, for example, and are not considered power functions.   Identifying power functions   Which of the following are power functions?                               Recall that power functions can be written in the form . can be any nonzero real number, while must be a rational number, meaning a fraction or finite\/repeating decimal.    is a power function with and .     is not a power function since the power is not rational. As a decimal, never repeats or ends, and we cannot write as a fraction.     is a power function with and .     is a power function with and . Remember that is allowed to be any real number, not just integers or rational numbers.     is not a power function because the variable is in the exponent, instead of the base. This is an example of a transcendental function, and we will learn about those next semester.       Notice that we say a function is a power function if it can be written in the form for some constants and ; it may not start out written that way. Sometimes it can take a great deal of algebra to determine whether or not a function is a power function \"in disguise.\"    For example, is the function a power function? If so, what are the numbers and ?    We can expand, factor, and then make a lucky cancellation to write this expression in the form :       Write the function in the form to see that it is a power function. What is the value of ? What is the value of ?      Integer Power Functions   Four Shapes of Integer Power Functions: The simplest power functions are those whose exponents are integers. It turns out that we can classify power functions with integer exponents into four types, depending on whether is even or odd, and also positive or negative. The next theorem illustrates these types for when . The graphs for are reflected over the -axis.   Integer Power Functions   If is an integer with and , then the graph of has the following shape, domain, range, and zeros, depending on whether is even or odd, and positive or negative:   is even. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ is odd.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{A power function with an integer and .}   is even. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ is odd.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{A power function with an integer and .}    For example, the first graph could be the graph of or . The second graph could be the graph of or . The third and fourth graphs could be the graphs of and , respectively.  Recalling Definition from the previous section, polynomial functions are sums of power functions with positive integer exponents , along with an additional constant term. Power functions with negative integer exponents are examples of rational functions.    Using the graphs from Theorem as a guide, determine the domain and range of if:    is even?     is odd?     is even?     is odd?     Instead of trying to memorize these, see if you can figure out why the domains and ranges of these functions are what they are.     The Size of Affects the Steepness: While the sign and parity (whether it's even or odd) of the integer power together determine the general shape of a power function , the size of determines the steepness of the curve.  For example, in below, , and all have the same basic \"U\" shape, but the red graph of is steeper on the ends and flatter in the middle than the blue graph of , and the green graph of is steeper and flatter still. In each of the following figures, the largest value of has the steepest and flattest curve.   , and . \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ , and .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Power functions with an integer and .}   , and . \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ , and .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Power functions with an integer and .}  Note that each of the four graphs shown in and goes through the point , because if , then regardless of the sign or the parity of the power . This means that none of the graphs are a vertical or horizontal stretch of one another. For example, the graph of is not a vertical or horizontal stretch of the graph of .   The Coefficient Stretches and Compresses: Multiplying by a positive constant produces a vertical stretch, multiplying by causes a vertical compression of , and multiplying by a negative number will in addition reflect the graph over the -axis. In each figure that follows we see the graphs of , and for some value of . In each case the graph of is the blue middle graph, the graph of is the green graph with heights doubled, and the graph of is the red graph whose heights are halved.   , and . \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ , and .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Vertical stretching and compressing of and .}   , and . \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.325\\textwidth} \\caption{ , and .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{Vertical stretching and compressing of and .}    Power Functions with Rational Powers  Things get a little more complicated when we consider graphs of power functions where is a reduced rational number , meaning that is a fraction that cannot be simplified. For example, when is even, will be undefined for negative values of , since we cannot take an even root of a negative number. A concrete example of this is when and , so that , and we know that the domain of is .  For positive rational powers there are six possible types of graphs that a power function can have:   Power Functions with Positive Rational Powers   If is a positive reduced rational number, then the graph of has the following shape, domain, range, and roots, depending on the parity of and and whether is greater than or less than 1:   If , then has one of the following three types of graphs:  with between 0 and 1.       If , then has one of the following three types of graphs:  with larger than 1.        Note that since is assumed to be reduced, we cannot have both even and even. Thus in the cases when is even, we must have that is odd.      For example, the graphs in could be the graphs of , and , from left to right, since , and are all between 0 and 1. Additionally, has even and odd. has odd and odd. has odd and even.  The graphs in could be , and , from left to right, since , and are all greater than 1. has even and odd. has odd and odd. has odd and even.    \\fbox{The point is not to memorize these graphs, but rather to think about what kind of shape they should have based on the power!  For example, when is even and is odd, the graph must be above the -axis because for , after taking the th root, we are raising to an even power of , which will make the function greater than or equal to zero.  On the other hand, when and are both odd, will be negative when is negative, and positive when is positive, since raising to an odd power will preserve whether the expression is positive or negative.  In the cases where the denominator of the power is even, requires us to take the root first. Always remember that we cannot take even roots of negative numbers, hence the domain is restricted to . }}  So far, we have examined power functions where is positive. What happens when the power is negative? By properties of exponents, we have and thus the function is the reciprocal of the function . This means that the height of at any point is simply the reciprocal of the height of at that point . For example, whenever is equal to 1, will also equal . Whenever is large, will be small; and whenever is small, will be large. Finally, if is zero, then will have a vertical asymptote, and vice versa, as illustrated in the following three figures.   Graphs of and their reciprocals      In the graphs in , do the blue graphs or the red graphs correspond to the functions with the negative exponents? Feel free to use a graphing calculator or Desmos. Then think about how you can tell from the formula. As a hint: what happens when ? What does the negative exponent mean?      Finding domains of power functions   Find the domains of the following power functions:                        If we rewrite the power function as a fraction with positive powers, the calculation of the domain is more clear: is defined everywhere but at , so its domain is . Note that the power of is not being applied to the coefficient , only to the .    Again, it's helpful to rewrite the function so that we can see roots and powers clearly. The function is defined everywhere except , because of the even root, so its domain is . Again, note that the coefficient 2 is not affected by the exponent.    Start by rewriting again. This time we must first rewrite as a fraction with positive exponents and then using integer roots and powers. is defined for all , because we can take odd roots of negative numbers but we cannot divide by 0, so its domain is .         Find the domain of .     Modeling graphs with power functions   Find power functions that could have the following graphs:          From the shape of the first graph , we know that if is a power function, then must be an even negative integer by in Theorem . Let's try the simplest possible case: . Then and imply that     For the middle graph , we need a power function of the form where is odd, is odd, and by looking at the middle picture of of Theorem . Since the graph here is reflected over the -axis, we need to be negative. The simplest power that satisfies these conditions is . Since , we have          By Theorem , the graph below belongs to a power function where is rational with even, odd, and .       Which part of Theorem matches this shape?    Assuming that (since this is the simplest possibility) so that , determine the value of by using the labeled point .        Using Square Roots to Find Distance  Power functions are extremely useful because square roots are used in many practical calculations. We have already seen the square root used when applying the quadratic formula to find the -intercepts of quadratic functions. Another use of square roots is in calculating distance.   Distance Between Two Real Numbers   The distance between two real numbers and is .      For example, we know that the distance between 5 and 3 is 2. Using the above formula:   Note that it doesn't matter whether we compute or : since once we square or , they are both equal to positive 4.    The above formula is a one-dimensional version of the more familiar formula for the distance between two points in the Cartesian plane: The Cartesian plane was named after the philosopher-mathematician René Descartes, who is credited as the father of analytic geometry and whose work formed the basis for the development of calculus. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/René_Descartes#Mathematical_legacy     Distance Between Two Points in the Plane   The distance between two points and in the plane is given by the distance formula :     Here is a basic example of how to use this formula:    Plot the points and on a set of axes, and sketch the line segment connecting these two points. Use the distance formula to find the length of this line segment.    The points and and the line segment between them are shown in :   The points and and the line segment between them.    The distance between and is     Here is an example of how this formula might be used in a real-world problem:    Suppose a straight road runs past a monument. If we create a set of axes that puts the monument at the origin (the point ), the road is described by the function , where is measured in hundreds of feet. Find a function that gives the distance from a point on the road to the monument.    If we call the monument , we have and . If we call a point on the road , then we have and , since any point on the road has coordinates . Since , we have that .  The distance is then     Let's take a moment to think about the function we created in the previous example and the properties it should have based on the context from which it was developed.    Let's consider the domain of the function , the distance (in hundreds of feet) between the monument and a point on the road with location .  Intuitively, if we consider the problem of finding the distance between a road and a monument, we should be able to find a distance for any point on the road. So in our model , the domain should be all real numbers.  Algebraically, note that since there is a square root involved, we need the quantity within the square root to be non-negative. The quantity in the square root is . This is a quadratic expression with discriminant , and so the expression is never zero. Plugging in, for example , we see that , and so the quadratic expression is always positive. In other words, the quadratic has no zeros and there is a point above the -axis, so we know it is always above the -axis. In other-other words, the expression is always positive! So the quantity under the square root is never negative, meaning that the function is defined for all .  We are relieved that our algebra and our intuition match. It bodes well that we did not make a mistake in developing our model.  We could also ask whether has any zeros and whether it is increasing and\/or decreasing. This would correspond to whether the road passes through the monument (it doesn't) and whether we get closer or farther away from the monument as we travel along the road (intuitively, we should first get closer and then as we pass the monument, we get farther). A graph of confirms both of these facts:   The graph of is never zero and first decreases, then increases.    Here is another thing we can see from the graph: the closest point on the road to the monument is at the location with . We will learn to determine all of these properties algebraically using calculus later in the course.    Another application of calculating the distance between points is the method of Least Squares Regression, which finds the line of best fit given a collection of data points:  https:\/\/www.mathsisfun.com\/data\/least-squares-regression.html . This method works by making the square of the errors between the points and the line as small as possible. These \"errors\" are precisely distances between points and the line that is being found. Least Squares Regression is a common method used for Statistical analysis in many different fields, from finance and economics to politics and sociology.    A Summary of Algebraic Functions  A function is algebraic if it can be expressed in terms of constants and a variable by using only arithmetic operations , and and rational constant powers of the variables. For example are algebraic functions, but and are not.  There are four basic types of algebraic functions, which we have already investigated: linear functions, polynomial functions, rational functions, and power functions. More complicated algebraic functions can be constructed by using sums ( ), differences ( ), products ( ), and quotients ( ) of these four basic types. gives a general form and examples for each type:   A summary of algebraic functions    \\toprule Type  General Form  Examples    \\midrule Linear  where and are any real numbers  ,         Polynomial  , where is a nonnegative integer and each is a real number          Rational  where and are polynomials          Power  where is real and is rational          Other  sums ( ), differences ( ), products ( ), and quotients ( ) of linear, polynomial, rational, and power functions  ,    \\bottomrule     There is a certain amount of overlap among the types listed in the table; for example, is both a power function and a polynomial function, and is both a power function and a rational function.  Functions that are not algebraic are called transcendental functions. In later chapters of this book, we will investigate four basic types of transcendental functions: exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. We will not go into their definitions or general forms right now; however, provides some examples:   A summary of transcendental functions    Type  Examples        Exponential         Logarithmic         Trigonometric         Inverse Trigonometric         Other       Identifying algebraic function types   For each function listed, determine whether it is a linear, power, polynomial, rational, algebraic or transcendental function.

The function is not algebraic, because it involves a nonconstant exponent. Therefore the function also fails to be algebraic and thus is transcendental.     is a quotient of algebraic functions, but not a quotient of polynomials , since is not a polynomial.

Therefore is an algebraic function that is linear, polynomial, and rational.         What is an example of a single algebraic function that is linear, polynomial, rational, and a power function (all of these at once). You have seen several       Summary  The following terms and formulas were introduced in this section: power function, power, exponent, coefficient, rational number; distance between two real numbers, distance between two points in the plane; algebraic and transcendental functions  Key ideas: Just like linear and quadratic functions, power functions have predictable shapes. There are too many of them to memorize, but we can remember some of them based on the size and parity of the exponent, the domain, and whether the function is always positive or not. Power functions are used to find the distance between points. We have now learned about all of the different types of algebraic functions and will learn about transcendental functions later.   Other ideas introduced: The coefficient of a power function affects the shape of the graph by vertical stretching or compression, and reflects it over the -axis if . An expression under an even root must be non-negative in order for the root to be defined.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.6}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

In this section we discuss functions that are NOT algebraic functions. Instead, they are pieced together by parts of algebraic functions.  A piecewise-defined function is a function that is defined in multiple pieces, with different formulas on different parts of its domain.    Let be the function defined piecewise by   This means that if we want to plug in an -value that is or less, we use the formula in the first row. If we want to plug in an -value that is greater than , we use the formula . So the domain for the function is still , but we use on and use on .  If we want to find the value , we observe that , and so we use the formula for this value of : .  If we want to find the value , we observe that , and so we use the formula for this value of : .  If we want to find the value , we observe that , because of the equal sign, and so we once again use the formula for this value of :   To graph , we begin by graphing the functions and that are used in the definition of , as shown in :   The graph of . \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.5in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.4\\textwidth} \\caption{The graph of .} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{The graphs of and .}  To graph , we use the graph of on the interval and use on . Whether these intervals are open or closed is important. To find we used the first equation : . Note that when we sketch the graph of below, we use open and closed dots to represent the function values corresponding to the ends of open and closed intervals in the domain, respectively.   The graph of uses for and for .        For the piecewise-defined function calculate , and . Then sketch a graph of .      An Application of Piecewise-defined Functions  Piecewise-defined functions are useful for many real-word problems where the relationship between the quantities involved are different on different time-frames. For example, a person's salary changes when they get a raise, which changes the amount that they earn each year.    Suppose that in your first job after graduating from college you make $36,000 a year before taxes. After four years you get a raise of $2,500. Two years after that you change jobs and go to work for a company that pays you $49,000 a year.  We can construct a piecewise-defined function that describes your pretax income in the year that is years after you graduate from college as follows. Note that this is just the function that describes your income rate per year at a time (the units are dollars per year).   What may be more interesting is to describe that amount that you will have earned  years after graduating from college. During the first four years, you make $36,000 per year, and so the amount that you earn after years is . After four years, you have already earned $ . Then for the next two years, you earn $38,500 per year, so your additional income for is given by (because we have to measure in years since  ). Thus overall for , you have earned by time . Lastly, after 6 years you have earned $ , and for each additional year you earn $49,000, so by time you have earned when .  Summarizing this, the function for total earnings at time years since graduation is   If you continue at that pay rate, how long will it have taken you to earn a million dollars? Well, we know we did not make that much by , so we use the equation for and solve for :   So in your 22nd year after graduating you will have earned one million pretax dollars.      How much will you have earned five years after graduating, according to the model described in Example ? What is your salary in that year?      For another example, suppose a doctor charges a different amount of money based on the length of the appointment. Example from https:\/\/www.mathsisfun.com\/sets\/functions-piecewise.html , accessed Sept 15, 2022.    Up to 6 minutes costs $50    Over 6 and up to 15 minutes costs $80    Over 15 minutes costs $80 plus $5 per minute above 15 minutes     We can write the price of an office visit like this:       Absolute Value and Distance  The absolute value function measures the size of a quantity, disregarding whether it is positive or negative. For a number visualized on the real number line, this also describes the distance of that number from 0. Said in another way, the absolute value of a real number is the magnitude, or size, of and is denoted .    For example, and .    The absolute value of \"makes the number positive.\" More precisely, if is positive or zero, then taking the absolute value should do nothing: in this case . However, if is negative, then taking the absolute value should change the sign: in this case .    For example, .    To define the absolute value function rigorously, we must use a piecewise-defined function. As just discussed, for positive numbers and zero, we must apply one rule (do nothing), and for negative numbers, we must apply another rule (multiply by ). Here is the formal definition, which says precisely that.   Absolute Value   The absolute value of a real number is      The quantity is not necessarily negative; it depends on whether the number is positive or negative. For example, if , then is positive. In Definition , only if is negative, in which case is a positive number .   Absolute values distribute over products and quotients; for example, the absolute value of a product is simply the product of the absolute values.   Absolute Values Distribute over Products and Quotients   Given any real numbers and , and .      For example, is equal to .     Non-Example   Note that absolute values do not distribute over sums and differences. For example, is not equal to .    The absolute value of any real number is the distance between and 0 on the real number line. Geometrically, the distance between any two real numbers and is the length of the line segment from to on the number line. Algebraically, this distance is given by , regardless of the signs of and .    For example, the diagram that follows shows that the distance between and is 3 units. Algebraically, .     Distance Between Two Real Numbers   The distance between two real numbers and is .      For each of the values of and that follow, sketch and on the real number line and visually find the distance between and . Then calculate and verify that it is equal to the geometric distance.    and      and      and      and      and        You may remember that we gave a different definition for the distance between two real numbers in Definition . These two definitions are the same, because of the following alternate definition of the absolute value function:   Alternate Definition of Absolute Value   For any real number ,     When is positive, the square root of returns us to the original -value. When is negative, is positive and the square root denotes only the positive square root, so the square root of will give us . (Remember, if is negative, is positive!) So this different definition is exactly the same as , just stated in a different way.  This idea can help us in solving the following types of common equations:    Find the solution of .    If we take the square root of both sides, we have   The comes from the following logic: if the magnitude of is 5, is 5 units away from 0 on the number line to either the right or the left. So could be either positive or negative 5 units from 0, meaning that .  Alternately, we could solve via factoring. Approached in this way, we have   Thus using either method, we can see that both and are solutions to the equation . Verify this by plugging in both numbers!   Important! It is very common for students to forget to include the when taking the square root of a square. The main lesson to be learned from this example is that equations have two solutions: .    Let's reconcile the two definitions for the distance between real numbers. Definition tell us that while Definition combined with Definition tells us that . Hooray! The two definitions agree.    Which definition of distance do you prefer? or ? Why? You can use either one. As we showed, they agree with each other.       Graphs of Absolute Values  The graph of is a combination of the graph of on and the graph of on :   The graph of .    Of course, in general we might wish to take the absolute value of a more complicated expression. In the more general case, we do exactly the same thing: the absolute value will leave positive quantities untouched, but flip the sign of negative quantities.   The Absolute Value of a Function   The absolute value of a function  is       For example, consider the function and its absolute value . When is positive or zero (meaning when ), the absolute value remains . But when is negative (meaning when ) the absolute value of is . The graph of is a combination of the graphs of and , switching between graphs at as shown in .

Let's write from Exercise as a piecewise-defined function and then graph it.  When is positive or zero, its absolute value will remain . When is negative, its absolute value will be . Therefore we have   Although this is one way to write as a piecewise-defined function, it is difficult to work with. For example, to evaluate we would need to know whether or when . To simplify this piecewise-defined function, we need to rewrite the conditions as intervals of -values.  Here is the graph of . We will use it to determine where and :   The graph of .    So we see that for and , and that for . Rewriting the piecewise-defined function in terms of these intervals:  Thus we have   You should take a moment to use this formula to check your answers to Exercise .   contains the graph of . Note that the graph of is the same as the graph of on the intervals and . On the interval where was negative, the graph must be reflected above the -axis to make the values positive when applying the absolute value.   The graph of is found by reflecting the negative parts of the graph of up above the -axis.        For the graph shown below, sketch the graph of by reflecting the parts of the graph with negative values over the -axis.   The graph of .        Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: piecewise-defined function, absolute value, distance between real numbers (again)  Key ideas: Piecewise-defined functions are not algebraic functions. They use different formulas on different intervals and their graphs are found by piecing together the graphs of the different formulas. Absolute value is an example of a piecewise-defined function and can be used to find distance. The graph of the absolute value of a function reflects the negative parts of the graph of the original function up over the horizontal axis.   Other ideas introduced: It would be great to have an algebraic way to determine when an expression is positive and negative, so we don't have to use a graph to find the absolute value of a function.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.7}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

  "body": " Solving Inequalities    Solving Inequalities     Learning Goals    Learn how to solve inequalities involving linear, quadratic, polynomial, and rational expressions    Solve an inequality to determine when a function is positive and negative    Solve an inequality to rewrite an absolute value    Solve an inequality to determine the domain of a function      Rules for Inequalities and Solving Linear Inequalities  As we have seen over the last few sections, in order to determine when a function is positive and negative, find the domain of a function involving an even root, and rewrite an absolute value, we will need to be able to work with inequalities. We will need to solve inequalities in order to explore functions in general and answer many interesting questions, and so we summarize the relevant rules and develop the necessary techniques for solving inequalities. Let's begin by defining what we mean by an \"inequality.\"  An inequality consists of two mathematical expressions related by a greater-than , less-than , greater-than-or-equal-to , or less-than-or-equal-to sign. The solution set of an inequality is the set of all values that make the inequality true. Wheres the solution set of an equation often consists of a finite number of points, the solution set of an inequality is often an interval of real numbers.    For example, the solution to is the single number . The solution to is the interval of numbers , or, written using interval notation, . This means that if we take any number greater than one and subtract one, the result will be positive (meaning greater than 0).    The next theorem describes what happens to inequalities when they are inverted or multiplied by a nonzero constant.   Algebraic Rules for Inequalities   Suppose , and are nonzero real numbers.   If , then . In other words, adding a number to both sides of an inequality does not reverse the inequality.    If and , then . In other words, multiplying both sides of an inequality by a positive number does not reverse the inequality.    If and , then . In other words, multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality .    If , then . In other words, taking reciprocals of two positive numbers reverses the inequality between the numbers.       In particular, notice that part (c) implies that multiplying an inequality by a negative number \"flips\" the inequality; for example, if , then . Part (a) illustrates that we may add any number to, or subtract any number from, both sides of an inequality without changing the direction of the inequality. Theorem is written in terms of strict inequalities  and , but similar results apply for the inequalities and .     Generate Examples: Create your own examples for parts (a)-(d) of Theorem by picking explicit, nonzero number for , and . Note that for part (b), must be positive and for part (c), must be negative (so you will need to pick different values of to illustrate those two parts). For part (d), and must both be positive.    We can use the rules in Theorem to solve linear inequalities in almost the same way that we solve equalities. The only exception is multiplying (or dividing) by negative numbers, or taking reciprocals.   Solving a simple inequality   Find the solution set of the inequality .    First, we can use part (a) of Theorem to add to both sides, which is the same as subtracting from both sides:   Next, we can use part (c) of Theorem to multiply both sides by , which is the same as dividing both sides by . Remember that this requires flipping the inequality!   Therefore the solution set of the original inequality is .     Checking the Answer   You can check the solution we just found by graphing (in red) and (in green), as shown in . The values of for which the line described by has -coordinate greater than are those to the left of .   is above for .        Consider the problem:  Determine where the function is positive.  Translate the phrase \" is positive\" into an inequality. Solve the inequality and then check your answer by graphing on Desmos or another graphing calculator.    \\fbox{ Important Note! Since multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number \"flips\" the inequality, you cannot multiply both sides of an inequality by a quantity whose sign you do not know. The following example illustrates a calculation where you must be especially careful about the algebraic steps you follow for precisely this reason. }    Suppose we wish to solve . You cannot multiply both sides of the inequality by , because may be positive or negative. Therefore, you do not know whether or not multiplying both sides of an inequality by will change the direction of the inequality. We will look at how to solve such an inequality later in this section.      Solving Inequalities That Involve Quadratics   If we want to know where a quadratic function is positive and negative, we need to be able to solve the inequalities and . However, this comes with significantly more complication than solving a quadratic equality, which we see in the next example.    If we try to solve the inequality by adding to both sides, we get . We may be tempted to divide by here, but remember, we do not know whether is positive or negative, so we do not know whether to flip the inequality! We must use an alternate method for this problem, which is motivated by Theorem below.    Solving quadratic inequalities is best accomplished by factoring and using a key property of the real numbers: a product of two real numbers is positive if the numbers have the same sign and negative if the numbers have opposite signs. This property is stated carefully in the following theorem:   The Sign of a Product depends on the Signs of Its Factors   If and are any real expressions, then    if and only if both and are positive ( and ) or both and are negative ( and ).     if and only if is positive and is negative ( and ) or is negative and is positive ( and ).       An easy corollary (meaning an immediate logical consequence that is interesting on its own) of this theorem is that if and only if either and have the same sign or one of and is zero.   Theorem reduces the problem of solving a factored inequality to the problem of solving a collection of related simpler inequalities.    For example, the expression in the inequality factors as . The product of and is negative exactly when and have opposite signs. It's difficult to recognize exactly which values of satisfies this condition, but it looks like it depends on whether is below 0, between 0 and 1, or above 1. (Note that when , and when .) In other words, the zeros of seem to break up the intervals where could be positive or negative.  In , we look at the sign of each factor of on the intervals between its zeros in order to determine the sign of the product. If we plug in a sample value of on each of these intervals, it becomes easier to determine the signs:   A sign analysis of    \\toprule Interval  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of                e.g.                   e.g.                   e.g.       \\bottomrule     For example, on the interval , we can plug in a sample value of . Then is positive, is negative, so the product is negative. From this we conclude that is negative on the entire interval . We will see in a later section why we can use a sample value on this interval to draw a conclusion about the sign on the entire interval. The theorem that tells us this is called the Intermediate Value Theorem.   We can summarize the information from Table in a sign chart on a number line by making tick marks at each -value that made the expression zero and writing (for positive) or (for negative) above each interval we tested, as shown in Figure . Note that we include tick marks only at the potential sign-changing points.   A sign analysis of , represented on a number line.      From our sign analysis, we see that is positive for and , and negative for . We wished to find the solution to the inequality and so we see that the solution is values of on the interval , which we write using interval notation as     In Example above, we can see that the quadratic function { changes sign} at and , where it is equal to zero. Visually, this is where the graph fully crosses the -axis:     As a rule, quadratic functions (and polynomials in general) are only able to change sign only where their graph crosses the -axis:   When Can a Polynomial Change Sign?   A polynomial can change sign only at values where it is equal to zero.    This theorem is a special case of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which we will explore in Chapter 2.   Important! Just because a polynomial can change sign does not mean that it does change sign. The following example illustrates this fact.

With enough practice, you will eventually be able to complete a sign analysis with only a number line to keep track of details and will not have to write out the entire table. In fact, by the end of the course, you will likely be able to carry out the majority of Exercise in your head, and in only a fraction of the amount of time it now takes. However, we will continue to provide the full table, along with the sign charts on number lines, throughout the rest of this section while you continue to develop your skills at this method. }    Application: Rewriting a Piecewise-Defined Function by Solving an Inequality  In this subsection we see how to use inequalities to rewrite functions involving absolute values as piecewise-defined functions.    We wish to write from Exercise as a piecewise-defined function without needing to rely on a graph of .  When is positive or zero, its absolute value will remain . When is negative, its absolute value will be . Therefore we have   Thus we need to determine where is positive and negative. For this, we factor and complete a sign analysis:  Since when , we test the sign of for , and :   A sign analysis of    \\toprule Interval  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of                e.g.                   e.g.                   e.g.       \\bottomrule     Summarizing this on a number line:   A sign analysis of , represented on a number line.      We see that is positive on and negative on . Thus we have        Solving Inequalities That Involve Products and Quotients   Recall Theorem : The Sign of a Product Depends on the Signs of its Factors. This theorem also holds for quotients: is greater than zero if and have the same sign and is less than zero if and have opposite signs. We can also generalize this theorem to products with more than two factors:   The Sign of a Product or Quotient Depends on the Number of Its Negative Factors   A product or quotient of nonzero real numbers is positive if and only if it has an even number of negative factors and is negative if and only if it has an odd number of negative factors.    For example, the product is negative because it has an odd number of negative factors. In contrast, is positive because it has an even number of negative factors.    As an illustration of the power of Theorem , consider the problem of solving the inequality .  Applying Theorem , the expression is zero only when and . (Note that is never zero; it is irreducible.) Therefore, these are the only two -values at which the expression can change sign. That means that the expression has the same sign on the entire interval , and the same sign on all of , and the same sign on all of . Applying Theorem , we can test the sign of each factor and multiply to find the sign of the entire product:   A sign analysis of    \\toprule Interval  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of                  e.g.                      e.g.                      e.g.        \\bottomrule     Summarizing this on a number line:   A sign analysis of , represented on a number line.      From this, we can conclude that is less than zero exactly when , and we have solved the inequality.    There is also a version of Theorem that holds for rational functions:   When Can a Quotient of Polynomials Change Sign?   A quotient of polynomials can change sign only at values where its numerator or denominator is equal to zero.    The next example applies this theorem to solving an inequality involving a rational function.    Determine where is positive and negative.    The expression can change sign only when either the numerator or denominator is equal to zero, by Theorem . and .  Thus we perform a sign analysis on the intervals , , and , testing the sign of each factor in the numerator and denominator and combining to determine the sign of the quotient according to Theorem .   A sign analysis of    \\toprule Interval  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of                e.g.                   e.g.                   e.g.       \\bottomrule     Summarizing this on a number line:   A sign analysis of , represented on a number line.      So we see that is positive on and negative on .    In the next example, we see how to solve an inequality where neither side is 0: we must rewrite the inequality so that one side is 0 and then perform a sign analysis. This requires further simplifying the nonzero expression to be a quotient of fully factored expressions.    Solve the inequality     Although it is tempting, recall that we can't multiply both sides of the inequality by because may be positive or may be negative (depending on the value of ). Instead, we will use some algebra to turn this inequality into one that involves a product or quotient of factors on one side and zero on the other:   Note that none of the above steps has changed the values of that can satisfy the inequalities. In other words, the inequality has the same solution set as the inequality .  Notice that the latter inequality is now a problem we have already solved! In Example , we found that the function is positive for . Additionally, the fraction is equal to zero when its numerator is zero, so for . Thus . Remembering that the two inequalities have the same solution sets, we realize that we have now solved the original problem, and conclude       Why is the square bracket used for the endpoint in Example but not the endpoint ?      Application: Finding the Domain of a Function with an Even Root    Find the domain of the algebraic function     To find the domain of , we ask which values of can be plugged into the equation that defines and produce a real number when the expression is simplified. In order for the value of to be defined for a real number , that value of must make the expression underneath the square-root sign nonnegative (meaning ) and the denominator appearing in nonzero (meaning ). Thus the domain of is the set of real numbers that satisfy:   In order to tackle the inequality, we need to rewrite the left-hand side as a single fraction:   The fraction can change sign when the numerator is zero: or when the denominator is zero: .  Performing a sign analysis for :   A sign analysis of    \\toprule Interval  Sign of  Sign of  Sign of                e.g.                   e.g.                   e.g.       \\bottomrule     Summarizing this on a number line:   A sign analysis of , represented on a number line.      Thus is positive on , and we know that it is equal to zero at ; it is undefined at . The equivalent inequality thus has solution . Note that the second condition, , on the domain is also satisfied.  Hence overall we have found the domain of the function by determining that and on the interval        Summary  The following terms and methods were introduced in this section: inequality, solution set, sign analysis of products and quotients.  Key ideas: The solutions of inequalities are intervals of numbers. Multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number requires flipping the inequality. The sign of a product or quotient depends on the number of its negative factors. A polynomial can only change sign where it is equal to zero. A quotient of polynomials can only change sign where its numerator or denominator is equal to zero. In order to solve an inequality involving a product or quotient, algebraically manipulate the inequality so that one side is 0, then perform a sign analysis on the nonzero side.   Other ideas reinforced: Finding the domain of a function with an even root can involve solving an inequality. Writing a function involving an absolute value as a piecewise-defined function can involve solving an inequality.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.8}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

Because every function is a process, it makes sense to think that it may be possible to take two function processes and do one of the processes first, and then apply the second process to the result.  Recall Dolbear's function, , from Example that relates the number of chirps per minute from a snowy cricket to the Fahrenheit temperature, .  The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are connected by a linear function. Indeed, the function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius is   For instance, a Fahrenheit temperature of 32 degrees corresponds to degrees Celsius.  If we are given a number of chirps, , we can combine the two processes given by Dolbear's function and the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius to obtain a new function that takes as input the number of chirps per minute and gives as output the temperature in degrees Celsius.    Suppose that we observe 80 chirps per minute. What is the temperature in degrees Celsius?  First, we compute that the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is .  Then, we compute that the temperature in degrees Celsius is     We could do this individually for each value of , but it would be more convenient to have a single formula that can go directly from number of chirps per minute to degrees Celsius. In the above example, we took the output and used it as the input for the temperature conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius. We can do the same thing using the variable instead of the explicit input :    Determine a formula for the new function that takes as input the number of cricket chirps per minute and gives as output the temperature in degrees Celsius.  Using as the input for the function , we simplify to find a formula directly from to that does not involve the variable :   So the function is given by     There is, of course, a shorthand notation for this process of using the output of as the input of :    is the function that first applies the process given by the function and then applies the process given by the function . Two natural questions we could begin by asking are: \"What is the domain of ?\" and \"What is the range of ?\"   Find the domain and range of the function .  We established in Example that has a domain of cricket chirps per minute and a corresponding range of degrees Fahrenheit.  The domain for is the inputs of , so is also the inputs of as that is the function that is applied first. Thus we can use the same set of -values and the domain of is also .  In order to determine the range, we must find the resulting degrees Celsius from the range of degrees Fahrenheit of . and . We know that a linear function's range will stay within these two values based on the shape of the graph. Thus the range of is in degrees Celsius instead of Fahrenheit, and is .      Definition of Composition of Functions  Suppose we have two function, and . has domain and range , while has domain and range . We write and along with their domains and ranges as and . As long as the range of matches the domain of , it is possible to link the two processes together to create a new process that we call the composition of and .   The Composition of Two Functions   If and are functions such that and , we define the composition of and to be the new function given by . We also sometimes use the notation , where is the single function defined by      The composition uses the outputs as the inputs of .    We sometimes call the inner function and the outer function . It is important to note that the inner function is actually the first function that gets applied to a given input, and then outer function is applied to the output of the inner function. In addition, in order for a composite function to make sense, we need to ensure that the range of the inner function lies within the domain of the outer function so that the resulting composite function is defined at every possible input.  In the following examples, we consider compositions of functions given by tables, then by graphs, and finally by formulas.    Suppose that and are given by the table     This means, for example, that , , , etc., and that , etc.  We can calculate . Since and , .  We can also calculate . Since and , .      For and as in Example , compute each of the following quantities or explain why they are not defined.             For what value(s) of is ?         If and are given by the graphs     then . Since and , .      For and as in Example , compute each of the following quantities or explain why they are not defined.                       Suppose that and that   The composition means that we use as the inputs for the function . Think of as the process that squares its input, then subtracts 1:   If the input is , we can simplify:   We could simplify this further if we wanted to, thought it isn't really necessary:   We could also compose the other direction. The composition means that we use as the inputs for the function . Think of as the function that multiplies 3 times its input, divides 4 by its input, then subtracts the latter from the former:   If the input is ,   We could simplify a littler further if we wanted to by distributing the 3, but anything farther would be a waste of time (like writing it as a single fraction over a common denominator):       Let and .   Find and simplify (as much as is reasonable) a formula for .    Find and simplify (as much as is reasonable) a formula for .         Suppose that . Determine formulas for two related functions, and , so that .    One possibility is that and .  Another possibility is that and .  Do you see any additional possibilities?    \\fbox{ Important! Function composition is not at all like multiplication. As we have seen in Example and Exercise , it is not necessarily true that or that . In fact, that is usually not true at all. }    Domain of Compositions  Suppose we have two functions, and . The domain of is the set of all in the domain of such that is in the domain of . In other words, is defined whenever both and are defined.    For and , we find the domain of .  For a value to be in the domain of , it must first be in the domain of . Then the value of must be in the domain of , so we must have , or in other words, . Therefore the domain of is .  For values of in this domain, we have . Notice that this equation is consistent with our calculation of the domain.      For and , find the domain of .      Recall the functions and from Example . Let's find the domains of and .  The domain of is . The domain of is all real numbers, so there is no need to limit the outputs of . Hence the domain is . We found a simplified formula of , which agrees with our previous analysis.  In the other direction, the domain of has no restrictions, but when we plug into , we notice that this requires the input to be nonzero because of the in the denominator, hence we must have in order for to be defined. Thus the domain for should be . Indeed, we found a simplified formula of   Since is in the denominator, we cannot have or . Thus the domain is indeed .     A Cautionary Example   Let's consider the functions and look at the domain of . If we view as the first function applied to , we know that we must have .  However, if we first simplify the formula for the composition: we might think that the domain is all real numbers, which would be incorrect!    \\fbox{ Remember! The domain of is the values of in the domain of so that the output of is also in the domain of . }    Function Composition and Average Rate of Change  In this section, we see how the idea of composition can be used in concert with the formula for average rate of change. You have already seen a few WeBWorK problems that involve doing this! Hopefully this section clears up any lingering confusion.  Recall that the average rate of change of a function on the interval is given by . In the figure below, we see the familiar representation of as the slope of the line joining the points and on the graph of . In the study of calculus, we progress from the average rate of change on an interval to the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a single value (what we might want to call the \"slope\" of a nonlinear curve). The core idea that allows us to move from an average rate to an instantaneous one is letting the interval shrink in size.  To think about the interval shrinking while stays fixed, we often change our perspective and think of as , where measures the horizontal difference from to . See below.   Think of the interval as the interval .    This allows us to eventually think about getting closer and closer to , and in that context we consider the equivalent expression for the average rate of change of on .  In this most recent expression for , we see the important role that the composite function \" \" plays. In particular, to understand the expression for we need to evaluate at the quantity .    Suppose that . Determine the simplest possible expression you can find for , the average rate of change of on the interval .    By definition, we know that   Using the formula for , we have and , so that   Expanding the numerator and combining like terms, it follows that   Hence , which is the average rate of change of on the interval .        Rewrite each interval , , in the form for some value of . What is for each interval.    Confirm the formula from Example by calculating the average rate of change of on , , and using the original formula and comparing it to the value of .    What would you estimate the \"instantaneous\" rate of change of at to be, based on this calculation? Remember that the instantaneous rate of change is what we get as we let the interval get smaller and smaller.        Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: composition of functions, instantaneous rate of change  Key ideas: The composition means to use as the input of the function . The domain of is a subset of the domain of so that is in the domain of .   Other ideas introduced: Composition of functions plays an important role in defining the instantaneous rate of change of a function, which is a central idea in calculus.  \\fbox{\\fbox{ End of Section 1.9}}  \\rule{1.1\\textwidth}{2pt}   "

Understand how the definitions of even and odd functions correspond to certain types of symmetry in the graph of a function.    Determine algebraically whether a function is even, odd, or neither.    Application: the vertex form of a quadratic function arises from a series of transformations of the function .       Transformations  In this section, we examine a few specific compositions of functions that give rise to what are called transformations . Given a function and constants , and , we could consider such modifications as , and . Each of these transformations changes graphically and algebraically.  What exactly is the result of adding or multiplying, and what difference does it make to do so on the inside versus the outside of the function? Take a moment to use this Desmos graph to explore for yourself. The original function is graphed in blue. Adjusting each of the sliders for , and will generate a new graph in orange corresponding to the modification , and . Note: you will probably need to access the Desmos graph via a computer, rather than a tablet or phone, in order for the sliders to work correctly.    Vertical Translation   Transforming to adds\/subtracts units to every output of . This means that the graph of shifts up or down vertically units everywhere, to become the graph of or , as illustrated by the red and green graphs, respectively, shown in below.   shifts up two units. shifts down two units.       Horizontal Translation   If we instead add or subtract a constant to the independent variable and transform to , the graph shifts left or right horizontally by units, as illustrated in the green and red graphs shown in below.   shifts left five units. shifts right five units.    Note that the shift to the left for and to the right for might be the opposite of what we might initially expect.     Vertical Stretch or Shrink   If we instead transform by multiplication to , then the graph of expands or contracts vertically by a factor of to become the graph of , as shown in the red and green graphs in .   stretches vertically by 2. compresses vertically by 2.       Horizontal Stretch or Shrink   In contrast, if we do the same transformation to the independent variable and transform to , this contracts or expands the graph of by a factor of in the horizontal direction, as illustrated in the red and green graphs in .   compresses horizontally by 2. stretches horizontally by 2.       Reflections: Note that in Examples and , the values of and used were positive. What happens if we multiply or by a negative number? We can answer that question just by looking at what happens when we multiply by .   Vertical and Horizontal Reflection   Changing to transforms all positive outputs into negative outputs, and vice versa. The graph of is then reflected across the -axis to become the graph of , as shown in the red graph in .  If we instead multiply the independent variable by , then we obtain a reflection across the -axis, as shown in the graph graph in .   reflects across the -axis (red). reflects across the -axis (green).      Now if we want to transform to , for example, we can transform first to and then by reflection to .  The table that follows summarizes the graphical and algebraic effects of the transformations just discussed.          Transformation  Graphical Result  Algebraic Result          shifts left units if      shifts right units if           shifts up units if      shifts down units if           horizontal compression by if      horizontal stretch by if           vertical stretch by if      vertical compression by if           graph reflects across the -axis           graph reflects across the -axis             Consider the function given in below. Describe in words how the function is the result of three transformations of . Does the order in which these transformations occur matter? Why or why not?   The function .      There are three basic transformations involved: a vertical shift of 1 unit down, a horizontal shift of 1 unit left, and a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. To understand the order in which these transformations are applied, it's essential to remember that a function is a process that converts inputs to outputs.  By the algebraic rule for , . In words, this means that given an input for , we do the following processes in this particular order:   add 1 to and then apply the function to the quantity ;    multiply the output of by 2;    subtract 1 from the output of .     These three steps correspond to three basic transformations:   shift the graph of to the left by 1 unit;    stretch the resulting graph vertically by a factor of 2;    shift the resulting graph vertically by units.     We can see the graphical impact of these algebraic steps by taking them one at a time. Note that in each of the following figures, we track the point from the original function.   In , we see the function that results from a shift of 1 unit left of the function in . The tracked point first moves left 1 unit to . (Each time we take an additional step, we will de-emphasize the preceding function by having it appear in lighter color and dashed.)  The function .       Continuing, we now consider the function , which results in a vertical stretch away from the -axis by a factor of 2, as seen in . The tracked point is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 away from the -axis to .  The function .       Finally, we arrive at by subtracting 1 from the previous graph; this of course is a vertical shift of units, and produces the graph of shown in red in . The tracked point is shifted 1 unit down to the point .  The function .        While there are some transformations that can be executed in either order (such as the combination of a horizontal translation and a vertical translation, in other situations order matters. In this example, we have to apply the vertical stretch before applying the vertical shift, Algebraically, this is because . The quantity multiplies the function by 2 first (the stretch) and then the vertical shift follows; the quantity shifts the function down 1 unit first, and then executes a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. In the latter scenario, the point that lies on gets transformed first to and then to , which is not the same as the point that lies on .     Vertical and horizontal translations, stretches, and reflections   The figure that follows shows a piece of the graph of a parabola with five marked points. Sketch graphs for each of the given transformations. On each graph, mark the new coordinates of the five marked points        , and      , and      and         Symmetry  Some graphs do not change under certain transformations. For example, the graph of shown in below remains the same if we reflect it across the -axis. We say that this function has -axis symmetry .   is preserved under reflection across the -axis.    As another example, the graph of shown in below remains the same if we reflect it first across the -axis and then across the -axis. This double-reflection across the - and -axis is equivalent to rotation around the origin by . Take a moment to experiment with this: on a piece of scrap paper, draw a smiley face or some other picture. Flip the paper vertically and then horizontally (or horizontally and then vertically). This gives you the same result as rotating the paper by 180 degrees. A function that is preserved under the transformation of rotation is said to have  rotational symmetry .   is preserved under rotation about the origin.    These types of symmetries are also called even symmetry and odd symmetry , since power functions with even powers all have -axis symmetry and power functions with odd powers all have rotational symmetry. Because graphical reflections correspond to multiplication by , we can describe functions with even and odd symmetry algebraically as follows:   Even and Odd Functions   Even functions have -axis symmetry while odd functions have rotational symmetry:   A function is an even function if for all in the domain of .    A function is an odd function if for all in the domain of .       For example, the function is even because for all we have . In contrast, the function is odd because for all we have   Note that many functions are neither even nor odd. In fact, it is quite hard for a function to be either even or odd, since this would require the graph to have one of these two specific symmetries.     is neither even nor odd. and so we can see that , thus is not even. Similarly, since , we can also see that , thus is not odd. Consequently, the function has neither -axis symmetry nor rotational symmetry. Confirm this for yourself by graphing using Desmos or a graphing calculator.      Sketch a graph that has neither -axis symmetry nor rotational symmetry. Congratulations! You have drawn the graph of a function that is neither even nor odd.     Testing if functions are even or odd   Determine whether each of the following function is even, odd, or neither.                     We first determine algebraically whether each function satisfies the definition of even or odd (or if it does not) and then verify graphically.   To determine whether is even or odd (or neither) we must calculate and determine if it is equal to , or neither. If , it is even, and if , it is odd. We have , so is an odd function since it satisfies .    We follow the same procedure to determine whether is even, odd, or neither. If , it is even, if , it is odd, and if neither of those two things is true, then it is neither even nor odd. Well , so is an even function.    Following the same line of reasoning, we must examine to determine if it is equal to either or , or neither. . This does not appear to be equal to either or . Indeed, . Hence the function is neither even nor odd.     The graphs of , and appear below in :   is an odd function. \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.3\\textwidth} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.25in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.3\\textwidth} \\caption{ is an even function.} \\end{subfigure} \\hspace{.25in} \\begin{subfigure}[H]{0.3\\textwidth} \\caption{ is neither even nor odd.} \\end{subfigure} \\caption{The graphs of , and confirm whether the functions are even, odd, or neither.}  We can see in that has rotational symmetry about the origin, which confirms that is an odd function. In , we see that has reflectional symmetry across the -axis, confirming that is an even function. Lastly, in , we see that has neither type of symmetry, confirming that is neither even nor odd.      Application: The Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function  There is another \"standard\" form in which you may see a quadratic function, called the vertex form :   Vertex form of a quadratic function   A quadratic function with vertex may be written in the form . The constant may be determined from one other point on the graph of the function.    This form arises from taking the parabola and applying appropriate transformations to obtain any other parabola as follows:   First, shift horizontally via . If the parabola must shift to the right, use a positive value for . If the parabola must shift to the left, use a negative value for .    Next, stretch the parabola vertically via . If the parabola must shrink, use a value of that is between and . If the parabola must be reflected across the -axis, use a negative value of .    Finally, shift the parabola vertically via . If the parabola must shift up, use a positive value for . If the parabola must shift down, use a negative value for .       We can reason graphically via transformations of to determine whether the parabola has 0, 1, or 2 -intercepts.  The vertex of the parabola has shifted left by one unit ( ) and up by nine units ( ) from the graph of , so the vertex of is in the second quadrant at the point . The coefficient of has reflected the graph over the -axis, so opens downward. Thus we know that must have 2 -intercepts. See if you can find them algebraically.      Simplify the vertex form of a quadratic function by combining like terms in order to determine formulas for the parameters , and such that . These will be in terms of the letters , and . (Hint: the formula for is .)  Recall from Exercise that we explored how the parameters , and impact the graph of . Experiment with the Desmos graph at  https:\/\/www.desmos.com\/calculator\/yayrd6etuz  if you do not remember. We see in this exercise how the values of , and are obtained based on the location of the vertex and width of the parabola.      Summary  The following terms were introduced in this section: transformations: vertical, horizontal, vertical stretch or compression, horizontal stretch or compression, reflection; -axis symmetry and even functions; rotational symmetry and odd functions; the vertex form of a quadratic equation  Key ideas: Adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing a function by a number results a predictable change in the graph that leaves some aspects of the shape of the graph unchanged. Some graphs have particular types of symmetry that confer special names on those functions (even and odd), and we can determine algebraically whether or not a function has these types of symmetry.

  "body": "  Consider the function given in below. Describe in words how the function is the result of three transformations of . Does the order in which these transformations occur matter? Why or why not?   The function .      There are three basic transformations involved: a vertical shift of 1 unit down, a horizontal shift of 1 unit left, and a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. To understand the order in which these transformations are applied, it's essential to remember that a function is a process that converts inputs to outputs.  By the algebraic rule for , . In words, this means that given an input for , we do the following processes in this particular order:   add 1 to and then apply the function to the quantity ;    multiply the output of by 2;    subtract 1 from the output of .     These three steps correspond to three basic transformations:   shift the graph of to the left by 1 unit;    stretch the resulting graph vertically by a factor of 2;    shift the resulting graph vertically by units.     We can see the graphical impact of these algebraic steps by taking them one at a time. Note that in each of the following figures, we track the point from the original function.   In , we see the function that results from a shift of 1 unit left of the function in . The tracked point first moves left 1 unit to . (Each time we take an additional step, we will de-emphasize the preceding function by having it appear in lighter color and dashed.)  The function .       Continuing, we now consider the function , which results in a vertical stretch away from the -axis by a factor of 2, as seen in . The tracked point is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 away from the -axis to .  The function .       Finally, we arrive at by subtracting 1 from the previous graph; this of course is a vertical shift of units, and produces the graph of shown in red in . The tracked point is shifted 1 unit down to the point .  The function .        While there are some transformations that can be executed in either order (such as the combination of a horizontal translation and a vertical translation, in other situations order matters. In this example, we have to apply the vertical stretch before applying the vertical shift, Algebraically, this is because . The quantity multiplies the function by 2 first (the stretch) and then the vertical shift follows; the quantity shifts the function down 1 unit first, and then executes a vertical stretch by a factor of 2. In the latter scenario, the point that lies on gets transformed first to and then to , which is not the same as the point that lies on .   "
