    <title>The natural exponential function and its derivative</title>
    <p>
      Our previous investigation into exponential functions yields some valuable qualitative information about their derivatives, as we now summarize. Let <m>f(x)=b^x</m>. 
      <ul>
        <li>
            <title>Exponential growth: <m>b&gt; 1</m></title>
          <p>
           If <m>b&gt; 1</m>, then <m>f</m> is an increasing function on <m>\R</m>, and hence <m>f'(x)&gt; 0</m> for all <m>x\in \R</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, since <m>f</m> is concave up on <m>\R</m>, we have <m>f''(x)&gt; 0</m> for all <m>x\in \R</m>, and thus <m>f'</m> is positive and gets more positive as <m>x</m> increases. This last quality can be also be seen as a consequence of the fact that exponential growth functions model percent growth: for each input <m>x</m>, the rate at which <m>f</m> is growing is proportional to its current value <m>f(x)=b^x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Exponential decay: <m>0 &lt; b &lt; 1</m></title>
            <p>
             Similar reasoning shows that if <m>0 &lt; b &lt; 1</m>, then because <m>f</m> is a decreasing and concave up function on <m>\R</m>, we have <m>f'(x)&lt; 0</m> and <m>f''(x)&gt; 0</m> for all <m>x\in \R</m>, which means <m>f'</m> is negative but becomes less negative as <m>x</m> increases. 
            </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Thus, qualitatively we have a good grip on <m>f'(x)</m> for an exponential function <m>f(x)=b^x</m>. But can we derive an actual derivative formula? Recall that exponential functions <m>f(x)=b^x</m>, where the input variable appears in the exponent, are not to be confused with power functions <m>g(x)=x^r</m>, where the input appears in the base. In particular, we cannot make use of the power rule <m>g'(x)=rx^{r-1}</m> to differentiate an exponential function <m>f(x)=b^x</m>. As such we must rely on the limit definition of the derivative. Let's see how far we get with this. We have 
      <md>
        <mrow>f'(x) \amp =\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^{x+h}-b^x}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^x\cdot b^h - b^x}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0} b^x\cdot \frac{b^h - 1}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = b^x \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^h-b^0}{h} </mrow>
      </md>.
      Interesting! Note that <m>b^x</m> is just <m>f(x)</m>, and the remaining limit expression in the last line is precisely <m>f'(0)</m>, assuming the limit actually exists. As such, assuming the derivative exists, we conclude that 
      <md>
        <mrow>f'(x) \amp =f'(0)f(x)</mrow>
      </md>.
      Let's reflect a moment on what this discovery means. Setting <m>f'(0)=c</m> for some <m>c\in \R</m>, we see that <m>f'(x)=cf(x)</m>. In terms of rate of change language, this means that the rate of change <m>f'</m> is <em>proportional</em> to the current value <m>f(x)</m>. This is exactly as we expected from our percent growth interpretation of the exponential function!
    </p>
    <p>
        We are certainly getting somewhere, but we are still significantly short of an actual formula. As it turns out, the remaining limit 
        <md>
            <mrow>\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^h-1}{h} \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^h-b^0}{h} </mrow>
        </md>
        is not one we can analytically compute with tools currently at our disposal. We can, however, estimate its value for various choices of base <m>b</m>. We do so below for the choices <m>b=2</m> and <m>b=3</m>.

        From these tables, we see that 
        <md number="yes">
            <mrow> \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2^h-1}{h} \amp \approx 0.693 \amp </mrow>
            <mrow>\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{3^h-1}{h} \amp \approx 1.099 \amp </mrow>
        </md>.
        So far this is pretty mysterious. Recall that, assuming that the limits exist, we have <m>\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{b^h-1}{h}=f'(0)</m>, where <m>f(x)=b^x</m>. Graphically speaking, this value represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(0,1)</m>. For <m>b=2</m> this slope is approximately <m>0.693</m>, a little less than one. It is no surprise that for <m>b=3</m> the slope at <m>x=0</m> is larger, approximately <m>1.099</m>, since we have seen already that as we increase <m>b</m>, the graph of the exponential function <m>f(x)=b^x</m> gets steeper at each point. This suggests that perhaps there is a base <m>b</m> between <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> for which the corresponding exponential function <m>f(x)=b^x</m> satisfies <m>f'(0)=1</m>. And indeed there is such a base <m>b</m>: this mysterious number is called <m>e</m> and has approximate value <m>e\approx 2.71828</m>.
