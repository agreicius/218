    <title>Elementary inequality rules</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen over the last few sections,
      in order to determine when a function is positive and negative,
      find the domain of a function involving an even root,
      and rewrite an absolute value,
      we will need to be able to work with inequalities.
      We will need to solve inequalities in order to explore functions in general and answer many interesting questions,
      and so we summarize the relevant rules and develop the necessary techniques for solving inequalities.
      Let's begin by defining what we mean by an "inequality."
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>inequality</em> consists of two mathematical expressions related by a greater-than <m>&gt;</m>,
      less-than <m>&lt;</m>,
      greater-than-or-equal-to <m>\geq</m>,
      or less-than-or-equal-to <m>\leq</m> sign.
      The <em>solution set</em> of an inequality is the set of all values that make the inequality true.
      Wheres the solution set of an equation often consists of a finite number of points,
      the solution set of an inequality is often an
      <em>interval</em> of real numbers, or unions of intervals.
    </p>

        <p>
          For example, whereas 
          the solution to <m>x-1=0</m> is the single number <m>x=1</m>,
          the solution to <m>x-1&gt; 0</m> is the set 
          <me>
            \{x\in \R\mid x&gt; 0\}
          </me>,
           which we recognize as the interval <m>(1,\infty)</m>. 
        </p>
      
    <p>
      The inequality in the last example was solved in much the same way the corresponding equality is solved:
      <md>
        <mrow>x-1 \amp &gt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x-1+1 \amp &gt; 0+1 </mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp &gt; 1</mrow>
      </md>.
      That is we isolated the <m>x</m> term by adding <m>1</m> to both sides of the inequality. The reason why this step is valid is that if <m>x&lt;  y</m>, then <m>x+a&lt;  y+a</m> for any <m>a\in \R</m>: <ie/>, adding a constant to two numbers <em>preserves the inequality relation</em> between them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What about multiplying both sides of an equality by a nonzero constant? Is it true that if <m>x &lt; y</m>, then <m>ax&lt; ay</m> for any nonzero <m>a</m>? No! Consider the following example: <m>1&lt; 2</m>, but <m>(-2)1=-2\not &lt; -4=(-2)2</m>. We have (re)discovered the first nuance about solving inequalities: multiplying numbers by nonzero constants doesn't necessarily preserve their inequality relation: in fact, if the constant is negative, the relation is reversed! Below we make official this observation, along with some other elementary inequality rules.

      The statements in <xref ref="th_inequalities"/> remain true if we place <m>&lt;</m> with <m>\leq</m>. Why? The relation <m>\leq</m> means less than <em>or equal to</em>. Since the statements above are true with respect to the relation <m>&lt;</m> (the content of the theorem) and to the relation <m>=</m>, it follows logically that they are true with respect to the relation <m>\leq</m>.

   <title>Visualizing inequalities</title>
   <p>
   The English phrases <q>less than</q> and <q>greater than</q> unfortunately obscure somewhat the meaning of the relations <m>&lt;</m> and <m>&gt;</m>. For example, we are tempted to translate the statement <m>x&lt; y</m> as <q><m>x</m> is smaller than <m>y</m></q>. But this is <em>not</em> what the <m>x&lt; y</m> means. Indeed, we have <m>-100&lt; 1</m>, and yet <m>-100</m> is not <em>smaller</em> than <m>1</m>. The correct way of understanding <m>x&lt; y</m> is as a statement about the relative position of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> on the number line. That is, we have 
    <md>
      <mrow>x&lt; y \amp \iff x \text{ is to the left of } y \text{ on the number line}</mrow>
      <mrow>x&gt; y \amp \iff x \text{ is to the right of } y \text{ on the number line}</mrow>

    Equipped with the inequality rules of <xref ref="th_inequalities"/>, we are able to solve elementary inequalities in much the same way we do equalities, but taking due care when multiplying by negative constants or taking reciprocals.

              </md>.
              Thus the set of solutions is the interval <m>(-\infty,-2)</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Clearly, we want to use the reciprocal rule here, but we need to be careful since to do so, the signs of both sides of the inequality have to agree! We handle this by separately treating the cases where <m>5/(x+1)</m> is negative and positive. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that <m>5/(x+1)&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>x+1&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>x&lt; -1</m>. In this case we certainly have <m>5/(x+1)\leq 8</m>. Thus the interval <m>(-\infty, -1)</m> is part of our solution. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now assume <m>x&gt; -1</m>. In this case <m>5/(x+1)</m> is positive, allowing us to use the reciprocal rule. We solve: 
              <md>
                <mrow> \frac{5}{x+1}\amp\leq 8 </mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{8} \amp \leq \frac{x+1}{5} \amp (\text{reciprocal rule})</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{5}{8} \amp \leq x+1 </mrow>
                <mrow>-\frac{3}{8} \amp \leq x</mrow>
              </md>.
              Thus <m>[-3/8,\infty)</m> is the set of all <m>x</m> satisfying the inequality with <m>x\geq -1</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Combining our two cases, we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is 
              <me>
                (-\infty, -1)\cup [-3/8,\infty)
              </me>.

      <title>Paying attention to sign</title>
      <p>
        Our solution to the second inequality of <xref ref="eg_ineq_elem"/> illustrates how careful consideration of the signs (positive/negative) involved in an inequality can make the solution even to an elementary looking inequality somewhat involved. The <q>sign diagram</q> technique developed later in this section will make these issues much easier to deal with. 
      </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Sign diagram technique</title>
    <p>
     <xref ref="th_inequalities"/> allows us to solve a linear inequality <m>ax+b&lt; c</m> almost exactly as we would the corresponding linear equality <m>ax+b=c</m>; we just need to be careful about the sign when multiplying both sides by <m>1/a</m>. With anything more complicated, however, solving inequalities becomes much more subtle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the <em>quadratic</em> inequality <m>x^2-x&lt; 0</m>. Since adding any constant to both sides preserves the inequality, we can add <m>x</m> to both sides to conclude 
      <me>
        x^2&lt; x
      </me>.
      We might be tempted to multiply both sides of the equation by <m>1/x</m> (we can exclude <m>x=0</m>, since the inequality clearly doesn't hold for this choice), however we need to remember that depending on whether <m>x</m> is negative or positive, the inequality might flip. This leads to two separate cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slightly more streamlined approach would be to use factoring: 
      <md>
        <mrow>x^2-x \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x(x-1) \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
      </md>.
      Now use the fact that a product of two numbers is negative if and only if the two numbers have different signs: 
      <md>
        <mrow>x(x-1) \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>(x&lt; 0 \text{ and } x-1&gt; 0) \amp \text{ or } (x&gt; 0 \text{ and } x-1&lt; 0) </mrow>
       <mrow>(x&lt; 0 \text{ and } x&gt; 1) \amp \text{ or } (x&gt; 0 \text{ and } x&lt; 1) </mrow>
       <mrow>0 \amp &lt; x &lt; 1</mrow>
      </md>.
      Note that the left side of our <q>or</q> statement was eventually discarded since there is no number <m>x</m> satisfying <m>x&lt; 0</m> and <m>x&gt; 1</m>. In all we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is the interval <m>(0,1)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should make official at this point our observation about the sign of a product of numbers. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_sign_prod">
    <title>Sign of a product</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be nonzero real numbers. We have 
    <m>ab&gt; 0</m> if and only if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same sign, and <m>ab&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have opposite signs. In other words: 
    <md>
      <mrow>ab&gt; 0 \amp \iff a,b&gt; 0 \text{ or } a,b&lt; 0</mrow>
      <mrow>ab&lt; 0 \amp \iff a&lt; 0&lt; b \text{ or } b&lt; 0&lt; a</mrow>
    </md>.
    </p>
    </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      A similar approach can be used for a more general quadratic inequality <m>ax^2+bx+c&lt; d</m>: namely, first make the right side of the inequality 0 (<m>ax^2+bx+(c-d)&lt; 0</m>); then try to factor the left side (<m>a(x-c_1)(x-c_2)&lt; 0</m>); then treat the different cases coming from <xref ref="th_sign_prod"/>. However, we are interested in one technique that works not only for quadratic inequalities, but also inequalities involving <em>any</em> algebraic function. This leads us to what we call a <em>sign diagram</em> technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider again the inequality <m>x^2-x&lt; 0</m>. We can interpret this as a statement about the function <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m>: namely, the set of solutions to the inequality is precisely the set of <m>x</m> where <m>f</m> is negative. This set is easily visualized by a graph of <m>f</m>. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_graph_ineq">
      <caption><m>f(x)=x^2-x</m></caption>
      <image width="65%" source="QuadExample1.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The graph confirms that <m>f(x)=x^2-x &lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>0&lt; x&lt; 1</m>, just as we had deduced above. It also brings to light another property that will be useful for solving inequalities: the sign of the function does not change until we reach a zero. In the example above, we have <m>f&gt; 0</m> on the entire interval <m>(-\infty, 0)</m>, <m>f&lt; 0</m> on <m>(0,1)</m>, and <m>f&gt; 0</m> on <m>(1,\infty)</m>. This is elegantly summarized by the sign diagram of <m>f</m> below.

  As it turns out, this constancy of sign exhibited by <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m> is enjoyed not just by all quadratic functions, but indeed by all algebraic functions. The property seems intuitively true: a function shouldn't be able to switch from positive to negative, or vice versa, without crossing the <m>x</m>-axis. However, to prove this property rigorously, we need some help from calculus: namely, the notion of a <em>continuous</em> function, as well as the <em>intermediate value</em> property that continuous functions enjoy. We will get to these in due time, at which point we will re-visit the discussion here. For now, we will take on faith this property of sign, that we articulate in the theorem below.

      To solve an inequality involving algebraic functions, proceed as follows.

        <li>
          <title>Standard form</title>
          <p>
            Use <xref ref="th_inequalities"/> to express the inequality in one of the forms 
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x)\amp &lt; 0 \amp f(x)\amp \leq 0 \amp f(x)\amp &gt; 0 \amp f(x)\amp \geq 0 \amp </mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>f</m> is an algebraic function.

        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Number line diagram</title>
          <p>
            Produce a number line diagram that includes points for all zeros of <m>f</m>, as well as any individual points where <m>f</m> is not defined. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Sign diagram</title>
          <p>
            Identify the sign of <m>f</m> on the resulting open intervals that have the points in Step 2 as endpoints. This can be done by evaluating <m>f</m> at a test point in each of these intervals, or by using elementary inequality properties. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Solve the standard form inequality derived in Step 1 by identifying the relevant intervals in your sign diagram.

<example xml:id="eg_ineq_sign_diag">
<title>Sign diagram: rational function</title>
<statement>
<p>
Use <xref ref="proc_solve_ineq"/> to provide another solution to the inequality 
<men xml:id="eq_ineq_sign">
  \frac{5}{x+1}\leq 8
</men>.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
We first bring the inequality into a standard form: 
<md>
  <mrow> \frac{5}{x+1}\amp \leq 8\amp </mrow>
  <mrow>\frac{5}{x+1}-8 \amp \leq 0</mrow>
  <mrow>\frac{5-8(x+1)}{x+1} \amp\leq 0 </mrow>
  <mrow>\frac{-8x-3}{x+1} \amp\leq 0 </mrow>
</md>.
The rational function <m>f(x)=(-8x-3)/(x+1)=-(8x+3)/(x+1)</m> is undefined at <m>x=-1</m> and has a zero at <m>x=-3/8</m>. Thus we begin with the number line diagram

\begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[latex-latex] (-2,0) -- (1,0);
        \path foreach \X/\Y in 
         {-1/-1, 0/{-\frac{3}{8}}}
            { (\X,0) node[circle,fill,blue, inner sep=0.5mm,
               label=below:{$\Y$}]  {}};
            <!-- \draw (-1.5,0.25) node {$f\colon$}; -->
            <!-- \draw (0,-.5) node{$f\colon $}; -->
       <!-- \draw(-1,.25) node{$+$}; -->
       <!-- \draw(.5,.25) node{$-$}; -->
       <!-- \draw(2,.25) node{$+$}; -->
        \end{tikzpicture}
</latex-image>

<p>
  Next we identify the sign of <m>f</m> on the three intervals <m>(-\infty, -1)</m>, <m>(-1,-3/8)</m>, <m>(-3.8,\infty)</m>. We can do this by using the following test points: 
<md>
  <mrow>f(-2) \amp = -\frac{-13}{-1}=-13&lt; 0</mrow>
  <mrow>f(-1/2) \amp =-\frac{-1}{1/2}=2&gt; 0</mrow>
  <mrow>f(0) \amp = -\frac{3}{1}=-3&lt; 0</mrow>
</md>.
From the constancy of sign theorem, we conclude that <m>f&lt; 0</m> on <m>(-\infty, -1)</m> and <m>(-3/8, \infty)</m> and <m>f&gt; 0</m> on <m>(-1, -3/8)</m>. This is summarized in the following sign diagram for <m>f</m>.

            \draw (-2,0.25) node {$f\colon$};

       \draw(.5,.25) node{$-$};
        \end{tikzpicture}
</latex-image>

<p>
Since furthermore, <m>f(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-3/8</m>, we conclude that the set of solutions to <m>f(x)\leq 0</m>, and hence to our original inequality <xref ref="eq_ineq_sign"/> is <m>(-\infty, -1)\cup [-3/8, \infty)</m>.

First bring the inequality into the standard form

The quartic polynomial <m>f</m> has no points where it is undefined. We factor <m>f</m> to find its roots. We have

Since <m>x^2+2</m> is never equal to zero, we see that the roots of <m>f</m> are <m>x=-1, 1</m>. Using the test points
