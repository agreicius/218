    <title>Elementary inequality rules</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen over the last few sections,
      in order to determine when a function is positive and negative,
      find the domain of a function involving an even root,
      and rewrite an absolute value,
      we will need to be able to work with inequalities.
      We will need to solve inequalities in order to explore functions in general and answer many interesting questions,
      and so we summarize the relevant rules and develop the necessary techniques for solving inequalities.
      Let's begin by defining what we mean by an "inequality."
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>inequality</em> consists of two mathematical expressions related by a greater-than <m>(>)</m>,
      less-than <m>(\lt )</m>,
      greater-than-or-equal-to <m>(\geq)</m>,
      or less-than-or-equal-to <m>(\leq)</m> sign.
      The <em>solution set</em> of an inequality is the set of all values that make the inequality true.
      Wheres the solution set of an equation often consists of a finite number of points,
      the solution set of an inequality is often an
      <em>interval</em> of real numbers, or unions of intervals.
    </p>

        <p>
          For example, whereas 
          the solution to <m>x-1=0</m> is the single number <m>x=1</m>,
          the solution to <m>x-1&gt; 0</m> is the set 
          <me>
            \{x\in \R\mid x&gt; 0\}
          </me>,
           which we recognize as the interval <m>(1,\infty)</m>. 
        </p>
      
    <p>
      The inequality in the last example was solved in much the same way the corresponding equality is solved:
      <md>
        <mrow>x-1 \amp &gt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x-1+1 \amp &gt; 0+1 </mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp &gt; 1</mrow>
      </md>.
      That is we isolated the <m>x</m> term by adding <m>1</m> to both sides of the inequality. The reason why this step is valid is that if <m>x&lt;  y</m>, then <m>x+a&lt;  y+a</m> for any <m>a\in \R</m>: <ie/>, adding a constant to two numbers <em>preserves the inequality relation</em> between them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What about multiplying both sides of an equality by a nonzero constant? Is it true that if <m>x &lt; y</m>, then <m>ax&lt; ay</m> for any nonzero <m>a</m>? No! Consider the following example: <m>1&lt; 2</m>, but <m>(-2)1=-2\not &lt; -4=(-2)2</m>. We have (re)discovered the first nuance about solving inequalities: multiplying numbers by nonzero constants doesn't necessarily preserve their inequality relation: in fact, if the constant is negative, the relation is reversed! Below we make official this observation, along with some other elementary inequality rules.

      The statements in <xref ref="th_inequalities"/> remain true if we place <m>&lt;</m> with <m>\leq</m>. Why? The relation <m>\leq</m> means less than <em>or equal to</em>. Since the statements above are true with respect to the relation <m>&lt;</m> (the content of the theorem) and to the relation <m>=</m>, it follows logically that they are true with respect to the relation <m>\leq</m>.

  <remark>
   <title>Visualizing inequalities</title>
   <p>
   The English phrases <q>less than</q> and <q>greater than</q> unfortunately obscure somewhat the meaning of the relations <m>&lt;</m> and <m>&gt;</m>. For example, we are tempted to translate the statement <m>x&lt; y</m> as <q><m>x</m> is smaller than <m>y</m></q>. But this is <em>not</em> what the <m>x&lt; y</m> means. Indeed, we have <m>-100&lt; 1</m>, and yet <m>-100</m> is not <em>smaller</em> than <m>1</m>. The correct way of understanding <m>x&lt; y</m> is as a statement about the relative position of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> on the number line. That is, we have 
    <md>
      <mrow>x&lt; y \amp \iff x \text{ is to the left of } y \text{ on the number line}</mrow>
      <mrow>x&gt; y \amp \iff x \text{ is to the right of } y \text{ on the number line}</mrow>

    Equipped with the inequality rules of <xref ref="th_inequalities"/>, we are able to solve elementary inequalities in much the same way we do equalities, but taking due care when multiplying by negative constants or taking reciprocals.

              We solve 
              <md>
                <mrow>3-2x \amp &gt; 7</mrow>
                <mrow>-2x \amp &gt; 4 \amp (\text{add } -3)</mrow>
                <mrow>x \amp &lt; -2 \amp (\text{multiply by } -1/2)</mrow>
              </md>.
              Thus the set of solutions is the interval <m>(-\infty,-2)</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Clearly, we want to use the reciprocal rule here, but we need to be careful since to do so, the signs of both sides of the inequality have to agree! We handle this by separately treating the cases where <m>5/(x+1)</m> is negative and positive. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that <m>5/(x+1)&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>x+1&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>x&lt; -1</m>. In this case we certainly have <m>5/(x+1)\leq 8</m>. Thus the interval <m>(-\infty, -1)</m> is part of our solution. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now assume <m>x&gt; -1</m>. In this case <m>5/(x+1)</m> is positive, allowing us to use the reciprocal rule. We solve: 
              <md>
                <mrow> \frac{5}{x+1}\amp\leq 8 </mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{1}{8} \amp \leq \frac{x+1}{5} \amp (\text{reciprocal rule})</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{5}{8} \amp \leq x+1 </mrow>
                <mrow>-\frac{3}{8} \amp \leq x</mrow>
              </md>.
              Thus <m>[-3/8,\infty)</m> is the set of all <m>x</m> satisfying the inequality with <m>x\geq -1</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Combining our two cases, we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is 
              <me>
                (-\infty, -1)\cup [-3/8,\infty)
              </me>.

      <title>Paying attention to sign</title>
      <p>
        Our solution to the second inequality of <xref ref="eg_ineq_elem"/> illustrates how careful consideration of the signs (positive/negative) involved in an inequality can make the solution even to an elementary looking inequality somewhat involved. The <q>sign diagram</q> technique developed later in this section will make these issues much easier to deal with. 
      </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Sign diagram technique</title>
    <p>
     <xref ref="th_inequalities"/> allows us to solve a linear inequality <m>ax+b&lt; c</m> almost exactly as we would the corresponding linear equality <m>ax+b=c</m>; we just need to be careful about the sign when multiplying both sides by <m>1/a</m>. With anything more complicated, however, solving inequalities becomes much more subtle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the <em>quadratic</em> inequality <m>x^2-x&lt; 0</m>. Since adding any constant to both sides preserves the inequality, we can add <m>x</m> to both sides to conclude 
      <me>
        x^2&lt; x
      </me>.
      We might be tempted to multiply both sides of the equation by <m>1/x</m> (we can exclude <m>x=0</m>, since the inequality clearly doesn't hold for this choice), however we need to remember that depending on whether <m>x</m> is negative or positive, the inequality might flip. This leads to two separate cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slightly more streamlined approach would be to use factoring: 
      <md>
        <mrow>x^2-x \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x(x-1) \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
      </md>.
      Now use the fact that a product of two numbers is negative if and only if the two numbers have different signs: 
      <md>
        <mrow>x(x-1) \amp &lt; 0</mrow>
        <mrow>(x&lt; 0 \text{ and } x-1&gt; 0) \amp \text{ or } (x&gt; 0 \text{ and } x-1&lt; 0) </mrow>
       <mrow>(x&lt; 0 \text{ and } x&gt; 1) \amp \text{ or } (x&gt; 0 \text{ and } x&lt; 1) </mrow>
       <mrow>0 \amp &lt; x &lt; 1</mrow>
      </md>.
      Note that the left side of our <q>or</q> statement was eventually discarded since there is no number <m>x</m> satisfying <m>x&lt; 0</m> and <m>x&gt; 1</m>. In all we conclude that the set of solutions to the inequality is the interval <m>(0,1)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should make official at this point our observation about the sign of a product of numbers. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_sign_prod">
    <title>Sign of a product</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be nonzero real numbers. We have 
    <m>ab&gt; 0</m> if and only if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same sign, and <m>ab&lt; 0</m> if and only if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have opposite signs. In other words: 
    <md>
      <mrow>ab&gt; 0 \amp \iff a,b&gt; 0 \text{ or } a,b&lt; 0</mrow>
      <mrow>ab&lt; 0 \amp \iff a&lt; 0&lt; b \text{ or } b&lt; 0&lt; a</mrow>
    </md>.
    </p>
    </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      A similar approach can be used for a more general quadratic inequality <m>ax^2+bx+c&lt; d</m>: namely, first make the right side of the inequality 0 (<m>ax^2+bx+(c-d)&lt; 0</m>); then try to factor the left side (<m>a(x-c_1)(x-c_2)&lt; 0</m>); then treat the different cases coming from <xref ref="th_sign_prod"/>. However, we are interested in one technique that works not only for quadratic inequalities, but also inequalities involving <em>any</em> algebraic function. This leads us to what we call a <em>sign diagram</em> technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider again the inequality <m>x^2-x&lt; 0</m>. We can interpret this as a statement about the function <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m>: namely, the set of solutions to the inequality is precisely the set of <m>x</m> where <m>f</m> is negative. This set is easily visualized by a graph of <m>f</m>.

            From our sign analysis,
            we see that <m>x(x-1)</m> is positive for <m>x\lt 0</m> and <m>x>1</m>,

            <m>(x+1)(x+1)</m> and so has a single zero at <m>x=-1</m> where it can change sign.

    <title>Solving Inequalities That Involve Products and Quotients</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Recall <xref ref="thm_signofproducts">Theorem</xref>: The Sign of a Product <m>AB</m> Depends on the Signs of its Factors.
        This theorem also holds for quotients:
        <m>\frac{A}{B}</m> is greater than zero if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same sign and is less than zero if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have opposite signs.
        We can also generalize this theorem to products with more than two factors:
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_gensignofproduct">
        <title>The Sign of a Product or Quotient Depends on the Number of Its Negative Factors</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A product or quotient of nonzero real numbers is positive if and only if it has an even number of negative factors and is negative if and only if it has an odd number of negative factors.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        For example,
        the product <m>(-2)(-1)(2)(-6)</m> is negative because it has an odd number of negative factors.
        In contrast,
        <m>\frac{(-3)(-2)(-8)}{(7)(-4)}</m> is positive because it has an even number of negative factors.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            As an illustration of the power of <xref ref="thm_gensignofproduct">Theorem</xref>,
            consider the problem of solving the inequality
            <me>
              (x^2+2)(x+1)(x-1)\lt 0
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applying <xref ref="thm_quotientchangesign">Theorem</xref>,
            the expression <m>(x^2+2)(x+1)(x-1)</m> is zero only when <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
            (Note that <m>x^2+2</m> is never zero; it is irreducible.)
            Therefore, these are the only two <m>x</m>-values at which the expression can change sign.
            That means that the expression has the same sign on the entire interval <m>(-\infty, -1)</m>,
            and the same sign on all of <m>(-1,1)</m>,
            and the same sign on all of <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
            Applying <xref ref="thm_gensignofproduct">Theorem</xref>,
            we can test the sign of each factor and multiply to find the sign of the entire product:

            So we see that <m>h(x) = \frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is positive on
            <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> and negative on <m>(-\infty,-1)\cup \left(\frac{1}{2},\infty\right)</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        In the next example,
        we see how to solve an inequality where neither side is 0:
        we must rewrite the inequality so that one side <em>is</em>
        0 and then perform a sign analysis.
        This requires further simplifying the nonzero expression to be a quotient of fully factored expressions.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex_nonzeroineq">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Solve the inequality
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x+1}\geq 2
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Although it is tempting,
            recall that we can't multiply both sides of the inequality by <m>x+1</m> because <m>x+1</m> may be positive or may be negative
            (depending on the value of <m>x</m>).
            Instead, we will use some algebra to turn this inequality into one that involves a product or quotient of factors on one side and zero on the other:
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}\frac{3}{x+1} \amp \geq2 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ original inequality } \\ \frac{3}{x+1}-2 \amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ collect terms so 0 is on the right-hand side } \\ \frac{3}{x+1}-\frac{2(x+1)}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ find common denominator } \\ \frac{3-2(x+1)}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ combine fractions } \\ \frac{3-2x-2}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ simplify numerator } \\ \frac{1-2x}{x+1}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ simplify numerator some more } \end{aligned}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that none of the above steps has changed the values of <m>x</m> that can satisfy the inequalities.
            In other words, the inequality
            <m>\frac{3}{x+1} \geq2</m> has the same solution set as the inequality <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that the latter inequality
            <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0</m> is now a problem we have already solved!
            In Example <xref ref="ex_signofquotient" autoname="yes"/>,
            we found that the function
            <m>h(x) = \frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is positive for <m>x\in \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>.
            Additionally, the fraction
            <m>\frac{1-2x}{x+1}</m> is equal to zero when its numerator is zero,
            so for <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Thus
            <me>
              \frac{1-2x}{x+1}\geq 0 \text{ for }  x\in  \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right]
            </me>.
            Remembering that the two inequalities have the same solution sets,
            we realize that we have now solved the original problem,
            and conclude
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x+1}\geq 2\text{ for }  x\in  \left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right]

      <title>Application: Finding the Domain of a Function with an Even Root</title>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the domain of the algebraic function
            <me>
              f(x) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{x}-2}
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To find the domain of <m>f</m>,
            we ask which values of <m>x</m> can be plugged into the equation that defines <m>f(x)</m> and produce a real number when the expression is simplified.
            In order for the value of <m>f</m> to be defined for a real number <m>x</m>,
            that value of <m>x</m> must make the expression underneath the square-root sign nonnegative
            (meaning <m>\frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0</m>)
            and the denominator appearing in <m>\frac{3}{x}</m> nonzero
            (meaning <m>x\neq 0</m>).
            Thus the domain of <m>f(x)</m> is the set of real numbers that satisfy:
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0\text{ and }  x\neq 0
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to tackle the inequality,
            we need to rewrite the left-hand side as a single fraction:
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}\frac{3}{x}-2 \amp \geq 0\amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ original inequality } \\ \frac{3}{x}-\frac{2x}{x} \amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ find common denominator } \\ \frac{3-2x}{x}\amp \geq 0 \amp  \amp  \leftarrow \text{ combine fractions } \end{aligned}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            The fraction can change sign when the numerator is zero:
            <me>
              3-2x=0\text{ when }  x=\frac{3}{2}
            </me>
            or when the denominator is zero:
            <me>
              x=0
            </me>.
          </p>

            Thus <m>\frac{3-2x}{x}</m> is positive on <m>\left(0,\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>,
            and we know that it is equal to zero at <m>x=\frac{3}{2}</m>;
            it is undefined at <m>x=0</m>.
            The equivalent inequality <m>\frac{3}{x}-2\geq 0</m> thus has solution <m>\left(0,\frac{3}{2}\right]</m>.
            Note that the second condition, <m>x\neq 0</m>,

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms and methods were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    inequality, solution set, sign analysis of products and quotients.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> The solutions of inequalities are intervals of numbers.
      Multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number requires flipping the inequality.
      The sign of a product or quotient depends on the number of its negative factors.
      A polynomial can only change sign where it is equal to zero.
      A quotient of polynomials can only change sign where its numerator or denominator is equal to zero.
      In order to solve an inequality involving a product or quotient,
      algebraically manipulate the inequality so that one side is 0, then perform a sign analysis on the nonzero side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas reinforced:</em>
      Finding the domain of a function with an even root can involve solving an inequality.
      Writing a function involving an absolute value as a piecewise-defined function can involve solving an inequality.
