    <title>Polynomial functions</title>
    <p>
      So far we have looked at linear and quadratic functions.
      Now we will expand to larger categories of functions,
      called <em>polynomial</em> and <em>rational</em> functions.
      These functions are much more complicated,
      both in appearance and in their properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before giving the formal definition, let's take a look at some examples of what we will call polynomial functions: 
    <md>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp =1-5x</mrow>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp =x^3</mrow>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp =3</mrow>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp =2x^4+1</mrow>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp =x^7+x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</mrow>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp = 4.23x^{517}-\sqrt{2}x^{24}+x^{6}-\pi</mrow>
    </md>.
      We next make a list of some common features of these functions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
           In contrast to linear and quadratic functions, these polynomials are seen to be sums of an unlimited (but finite) number of terms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Each term is either constant or a number times a power of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The power of <m>x</m> is always a positive whole number, though the constant in front may be any real number whatsoever. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Lastly, we synthesize these observations in a formal definition.

        In this sense <xref ref="d_polynomialfunction"/> is a generalization of these earlier definitions. As such our <em>parametric</em> manner of understanding linear and quadratic (and constant) functions applies more generally to polynomials. In this more general setting, the coefficients <m>a_0,a_1,\dots, a_n</m> appearing in the general formula 
        <me>
          f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1+a_0

      <title>Zero function and zero polynomial</title>
      <p>
        A function <m>f\colon D\rightarrow \R</m> is called a <term>zero function</term> if <m>f(x)=0</m> for all <m>x\in D</m>. Observe that a zero function is also a polynomial according to <xref ref="d_polynomialfunction"/>. Indeed we have 
        <me>
          f(x)=a_0

        where <m>a_0=0</m>. Because of this, zero functions are also called <term>zero polynomials</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the formula for the zero polynomial has no nonzero coefficients, the notion of degree given in <xref ref="d_polynomialfunction"/> does not apply: <ie/>, technically for us the zero polynomial does not have a degree. There is not a fast and fixed convention on this point in the mathematics literature: some texts declare the degree of the zero polynomial to be undefined; still others declare the degree of the zero polynomial to be <m>-\infty</m>!

                As discussed in <xref ref="rm_cons_lin_quad"/>, all constant functions are polynomials (corresponding to the choice <m>n=0</m>). In this case the constant term of <m>f</m> is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. Since <m>\sqrt{2}\ne 0</m>, this is also the leading term and leading coefficient of <m>f</m>, and we have <m>\deg f=0</m>.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As discussed in <xref ref="rm_zero_poly"/>, the zero function (or zero polynomial) is indeed a polynomial. However, since no nonzero coefficients appear in its formula, the notions of leading term, leading coefficient, and degree do not apply.

            <li>
              <p>
                The given function is indeed a polynomial, though we need to do some algebra to recognize that it has a formula of the form <xref ref="eq_poly"/>:

                Once in this form, we see that the constant term of <m>f</m> is <m>0</m>, its leading term is <m>3x^4</m>, its leading coefficient is <m>3</m>, and its degree is <m>4</m>.

      Higher degrees often result in more <m>x</m>-intercepts,
      a.k.a. zeros,
      and more local minima and maxima in the graph of a polynomial.
    </p>
    <example>

          Examine the cubic, quartic,
          and quintic polynomials in <xref ref="fig_polynomials">Figure</xref> below.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_polynomials">
          <caption>A cubic (left), quartic (middle), and quintic (right) polynomial and their graphs.</caption>
          <image width="92.5%" source="TaalmanPage313.pdf"/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The cubic polynomial <m>f(x) = x^3+x^2-2x</m> on the left has three <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>x=-2</m>,
          <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
          Note that we can see this from the factored form of
          <m>f(x) = x(x-1)(x+2)</m> by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            x=0\text{ and }  x-1=0\text{ and }  x+2=0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quartic polynomial <m>g(x) = x^4+x^3-2x^2</m> in the middle also has three <m>x</m>-intercepts <m>x=-2</m>,
          <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
          When factored, <m>g(x) = x^2(x-1)(x+2)</m>,
          and we can see that the <m>x</m>-intercept <m>x=0</m> comes from setting the factor <m>x^2</m> equal to 0, while <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=-2</m> come from <m>x-1=0</m> and <m>x+2=0</m>,
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quintic polynomial <m>h(x) = x^5-x^4-4x^3+4x^2</m> on the right has four zeros:
          <m>x=-2, 0, 1</m>, and <m>2</m>.
          When factored,
          <m>h(x) = x^2(x-1)(x+2)(x-2)</m> and we can see that each factor corresponds to an <m>x</m>-intercept again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>f(x)</m> has one local minimum and one local maximum.
          <m>g(x)</m> has two local minima and one local maxima,
          and that the local minimum at
          <m>x\approx-1.5</m> is also a global minimum.
          <m>h(x)</m> has two local maxima and two local minima.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      You may be wondering if there is a pattern or rule in the number of <m>x</m>-intercepts and local minima/maxima that a polynomial function has.
      It turns out that, yes, there is,
      but it is more complicated than our observations of linear and quadratic functions.
      There is a very powerful theorem
      (called <em>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</em>)
      that says that every polynomial function can be factored into linear factors and/or
      <em>irreducible</em> quadratic factors.
      Each of the linear factors corresponds to an <m>x</m>-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quadratic expression is <em>irreducible</em>
      if it cannot be factored with real-number coefficients;
      that is <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> is irreducible if it cannot be written in the form
      <m>a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)</m> for some real numbers <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.
      Since each factor would correspond to an <m>x</m>-intercept:
      <me>
        x-r_1=0\text{ when }  x=r_1\text{ is an \(x\)-intercept }
      </me>
      <me>
        x-r_2=0\text{ when }  x=r_2\text{ is an \(x\)-intercept }
      </me>
      a quadratic expression is irreducible if the equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> has no solution.
      We already know that the equation
      <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> has no solution if the discriminant <m>b^2-4ac</m> is negative,
      so we know that a quadratic expression
      <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> is irreducible if and only if its discriminant <m>b^2-4ac</m> is negative
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the quadratic expression <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible.
          We can rewrite
          <me>
            x^2+1 =1\cdot x^2+0\cdot x+1
          </me>
          in order to see that <m>a=1, b=0, c=1</m> and then compute the discriminant:
          <me>
            b^2-4ac = 0^2-4(1)(1)  = -4
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the discriminant <m>-4</m> is negative,
          the quadratic expression <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible.
          It does not factor and we can see graphically that it does not have any zeros:

      \fbox{ Note that every linear factor <m>(x-r)</m> of a polynomial corresponds to an <m>x</m>-intercept <m>x=r</m> of that polynomial,
      since if a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> can be factored as
      <m>(x-r)g(x)</m> for some other polynomial <m>g(x)</m> (meaning,
      if <m>(x-r)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>), then
      <me>
        f(r)=(r-r)g(r) = 0
      </me>
      and thus <m>x=r</m> is an <m>x</m>-intercept of <m>f(x)</m>.
      The converse is also true:
      if <m>x=r</m> is an <m>x</m>-intercept of <m>f(x)</m>,
      then <m>f(x)</m> has linear factor <m>x-r</m>:

        f(x) = (x-r)g(x)

        <p>
          The polynomials in <xref ref="fig_polynomials">Figure</xref>
          on the previous page have already been factored for us.
          We can see that the cubic polynomial
          <m>f(x) = x^3+x^2-2x = x(x-1)(x+2)</m> has three <m>x</m>-intercepts.
          The <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=-2</m> corresponds to the linear factor <m>x+2</m>.
          The <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=1</m> corresponds to the linear factor <m>x-1</m>.
          The <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=0</m> corresponds to the linear factor <m>x=x-0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>g(x)</m> also has three <m>x</m>-intercept,
          despite being a fourth-degree polynomial.
          This is because there are two linear factors with the same <m>x</m>-intercept of <m>x=0</m> since the factorization of <m>g(x)</m> includes <m>x^2 = x\cdot x</m>.

          The quintic (degree-five) polynomial <m>h(x)</m> has four <m>x</m>-intercepts,
          again with a double-<m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x=0</m> corresponding to the linear factor <m>x^2</m>.
        </p>

    </example>
    <p>
      When a linear factor <m>x-r</m> occurs more than once in the factorization of a polynomial <m>f</m>,
      we say that <m>f</m> has a <em>repeated zero</em> at <m>x=r</m>.
      We say that repeated zeros are <em>double zeros</em>
      if the factorization includes <m>(x-r)^2</m>,
      <em>triple zeros</em> if the factorization includes <m>(x-r)^3</m>,
      and so on,
      according to the number of times the factor <m>x-r</m> is repeated.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          the function <m>f(x) = (x+1)(x-2)^2(x-6)</m> has a double zero at <m>x=2</m> and the polynomial
          <m>g(x) = (x+1)^3(x-2)^4</m> has a triple zero at <m>x=-1</m> and a quadruple zero at <m>x=2</m>.
          Notice in the graphs of these functions that there is some interesting behavior at the repeated zero:
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          In the first figure,
          the graph of <m>f</m> does not go straight through the <m>x</m>-axis at the double zero <m>x=2</m>;
          instead, it bounces off, much like a concave-down parabola.
          In the second graph,
          the triple zero at <m>x=-1</m> behaves like the graph of <m>y=x^3</m> near its <m>x</m>-intercept and the quadruple zero behaves like the graph of <m>y=x^4</m> next its <m>x</m>-intercept.
          This phenomenon happens in general:
          a zero repeated <m>m</m>-times as a linear factor is graphically similar to the graph of <m>y=x^m</m> near its <m>x</m>-intercept.

          Give formulas and graphs for three cubic polynomials:
          one with three distinct real zeros,
          one with two distinct real zeros,
          and one with only one real, non-repeated, zero.
        </p>

      <solution>
        <p>
          To construct a cubic polynomial with three distinct real zeros we simply multiply together three distinct linear factors,
          as shown in the picture below at the left.
          To obtain exactly two distinct zeros we can make one of our factors repeated,
          as in the middle picture.
          Finally, to have only one zero that is not repeated,
          we can multiply a linear factor and an irreducible quadratic factor,
          since irreducible quadratic factors do not have any real zeros;
          see the right-most picture.
          Note that the left and middle pictures both have two turning points,
          while the third picture has none.

      However, just because a polynomial <em>has</em>
      a factorization doesn't mean that we have an easy way to actually factor that polynomial!
      In general, factoring a polynomial is extremely hard, and is often impossible;
      there is no mathematical formula for finding the zeros of polynomials of degree 5 and higher.<fn>
      It's not that nobody has found such a formula yet.
      It has actually been proven as mathematical fact that it is
      <em>impossible</em> to find such a formula.
      How would you even prove that something is impossible?

    <title>Definition of Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      A rational number is a number that can be written as a quotient (a.k.a. fraction) of the simplest possible numbers you can imagine, namely,
      integers.
      For example, <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> and <m>-\frac{10}{7}</m>.
      Similarly, a rational <em>function</em>
      is a quotient of simpler functions, namely, polynomials.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="d_rationalfunctions">
      <title>Rational Functions are Quotients of Polynomials</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <em>rational function</em> is a function that can be written as the quotient of two polynomial functions
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_1x+a_0}{b_mx^m+b_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\ldots+b_1x+b_0}
          </me>
          for any <m>x</m> such that <m>q(x)\neq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Just like our previous definitions for functions,
      the key realization is that a rational function <em>can</em>
      be written in such a form.
      It does not have to begin that way.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We rewrite the function <m>f(x) = x-1+\frac{1}{2x+1}</m> as a rational function by finding a common denominator,
          adding fractions, then simplifying:
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x-1+\frac{1}{2x+1}  \amp = (x-1)\cdot\frac{2x+1}{2x+1}+\frac{1}{2x+1}\\ \amp \\ \amp = \frac{(x-1)(2x+1)}{2x+1}+\frac{1}{2x+1}\\ \amp \\ \amp = \frac{(x-1)(2x+1)+1}{2x+1}\\ \amp \\ \amp = \frac{(2x^2-x-2x-1)+1}{2x+1}\\ \amp \\ \amp =\frac{2x^2-3x}{2x+1} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that <m>f(x)</m> is rational because it can be written as a fraction of the polynomial <m>2x^2-3x</m> divided by the polynomial <m>2x+1</m>.

    <title>Domain and Zeros of Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      Remember that we cannot divide by 0.
      Using this idea,
      we can see from Definition <xref ref="d_rationalfunctions" autoname="yes"/> that the
      <em>domain of a rational function</em>
      is all <m>x</m>-values that are <em>not</em>
      zeros of the denominator of that function.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's find the domains of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
          <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{x-1}</m>, and <m>h(x) = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+2)}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is <m>x\neq 0</m>.
          We can write this using interval notation as <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)</m>.

          The domain of <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{x-1}</m> is <m>x\neq 1</m>.

        </p>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>h(x) = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+2)}</m> is <m>x\neq 1, -2</m>.
          We can write this using interval notation as <m>(-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>.

          Find the domain of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{x+5}{x^3+x^2-2x}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that the domain of a rational function is all <m>x</m>-values that are <em>not</em>
          zeros of the denominator.
          Thus we set the denominator
          <m>x^3+x^2-2x</m> equal to 0 and solve for <m>x</m>,
          which will give us the <m>x</m>-values to exclude from the domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Factoring, we have
          <me>
            \begin{aligned}x^3+x^2-2x \amp = x(x^2+x-2)\\ \amp = x(x+2)(x-1) \amp =0 \end{aligned}
          </me>
          when
          <me>
            x=0 x+2=0  x-1=0

          and so when <m>x=0, -2, 1</m>.
        </p>

          Thus the domain is <m>x\neq -2, 0, 1</m> since those are the <m>x</m>-values where the denominator is equal to 0.
          Using interval notation we can write the domain as
          <me>
            (-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,0)\cup(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)

      What do the graphs of rational functions look like?
      They can be very interesting,
      especially because as we get close to <m>x</m>-values that are not in the domain of the function,
      we are getting close to a point where we are dividing by 0.
      However, graphs of rational functions are highly dependent on small changes in their numerators and denominators.
      Pay careful attention to the details in the next example,
      especially the number of times that each linear factor is repeated in the numerator and/or denominator:

          The domain of all three functions is
          <m>\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\neq 1, 3\} = (-\infty,1)\cup(1,3)\cup(3,\infty)</m> since in all three functions,
          <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m> are the zeros of the denominator.
          However, we can see that the functions have very different properties at <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m>.
          <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have a
          <em>vertical asymptote</em>
          at <m>x=1</m> and a <em>hole</em> at <m>x=3</m>.
          On the other hand,
          <m>h(x)</m> has vertical asymptotes at both <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m>.
          We will look at some of the reasons for these here,
          but we will have to leave the details to explore later when we develop our language of <em>limits</em>.

    <p>
      The reason why <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> above have a hole at <m>x=3</m> instead of a vertical asymptote is related to the following theorem:

          For example,
          if you can cancel a common factor <m>x-c</m> from the numerator and denominator of a fraction,
          the cancelled expression will equal the original expression for all values of <m>x</m>
          <em>except</em> <m>x=c</m>.
          One illustration of this theorem is the cancellation
          <me>
            \frac{(x-3)}{(x-3)(x-1)} = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{x-1},\amp  \text{ if } x\neq 3\\ \text{ undefined } , \amp  \text{ if } x=3 \end{cases}

          the function <m>f(x) = \frac{x-3}{(x-3)(x-1)}</m> has a hole at <m>x=3</m> instead of a zero or vertical asymptote because algebraically,
          we can cancel the common <m>x-3</m>:
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{(x-3)}{(x-3)(x-1)} = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{x-1},\amp  \text{ if } x\neq 3\\ \text{ undefined } , \amp  \text{ if } x=3 \end{cases}

        <p>
          Thus the graph of <m>f(x)</m> in <xref ref="ex_rationalfunctions">Example</xref>
          looks identical to the graph of <m>y=\frac{1}{x-1}</m> <em>except</em>
          at the point <m>x=3</m> where <m>f(x)</m> is undefined.
          We represent this undefined point on the graph with a hole.

        <p>
          As we saw in Example <xref ref="ex_domainofrational" autoname="yes"/>,
          the domain of the function

          we find the zeros by setting the numerator equal to zero,
          and also checking that the denominator is not equal to zero.

          We already found in Example <xref ref="ex_domainofrational" autoname="yes"/> that the denominator is equal to zero for <m>x=-2,0,1</m>,

          The domain of <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-1}{x+1}</m> is where the denominator <m>x+1\neq 0</m>,

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      The following terms were introduced in this section:
    </p>
    polynomial function, degree, coefficient, leading coefficient, leading term, constant term; cubic, quartic, quintic polynomial; irreducible quadratic, repeated zero, double zero, triple zero; turning point; vertical asymptote, hole.
    <p>
      <em>Key ideas:</em> Linear factors of a polynomial function correspond to zeros,
      and a polynomial function of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> zeros.
      Rational functions are undefined where their denominators are equal to zero.
      They have zeros where their numerators are equal to zero,
      provided that the denominator is not also equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other ideas introduced:</em>
      Polynomial functions of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n-1</m> turning points.
      Rational functions can have either vertical asymptotes or holes at points where they are undefined.
      Factoring is <em>really hard</em>
      and often impossible for higher-degree polynomials.
